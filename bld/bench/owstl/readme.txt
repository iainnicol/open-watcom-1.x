This directory contains benchmark programs that exercise various aspects
of Open Watcom STL. The intent of these programs is to provide data for
the profiler so that "performance bugs" can be noticed and addressed.
These programs are not intended to exercise the facilities of OWSTL in a
realistic way. Instead each program is focused on one individual
facility---or on a small set of close related facilities---with the
intent of helping that one facility become optimized.
