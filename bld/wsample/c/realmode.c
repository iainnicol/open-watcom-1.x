/*
    timer_handler is the main working component of this program.
    A PC (or PS/2) has a built-in timer that keeps interrupting processor
    in regular intervals and causes it to execute INT 08H. We substitute
    the regular routine that would be then called, by changing its FAR_PTR pointer
    stored at &INT_LOCATE( 0x08 ). The previous value is saved as
    old_timer_handler to be used from withing our handler so that nothing is
    changed to the function of the interrupt (which is normaly used to update
    tics counter which in turn is essential to operation of some system io
    routines).  Since the hardware timer frequency is modified to suit our
    purposes, a TimerMod is maintained to assure the old_timer_handler is
    invoked with its original frequency.

    Furthermore, since the interrupt is of hardware type, it involves mediation
    of 8259 chip. This chip expects being told when the interrupt processing is
    over so that it may allow subsequent hard interrupts to be acknowledged.
    'old_timer_handler' does that by itself but if it isn't called, an explicit
    outp( INT_CTRL, EOI ) instruction has to be issued. This EOI (End Of
    Interrupt) must be signaled before any call to INT 21H is made (i.e.
    before any io is requested).
    The above was mentionned so that you have an idea of the reasons behind
    the order relationship of instructions in the following procedure.
    NOTE: if you rid this function of all the comment then it really is short
    and things start making sense.
