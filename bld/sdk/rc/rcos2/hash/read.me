The split of the keyword between rc1.key and rc2.key occurs at the first letter.
If you must change the place of the split, make sure that all words with the
same first letter occur in the same file and also change the first letter in
the file keyword.c

The current point of the split is:  <='i'   rc1.key
				    > 'i'   rc2.key

NOTE: Until inline preprocessing is in place no "line" keyword should be added
since the HandleCPPDirective function uses Scan to find #line directives.
