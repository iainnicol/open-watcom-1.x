Differences between some versions of IBM's RC and WRC
-----------------------------------------------------

 - WRC recogizes octal constants such as 007, 056 etc. Hence values such as 008
   are considered to be an error. This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5
   and also consistent with the C/C++ language.

 - There are differences in parsing statements such as

   #define IDR_ACCEL   1
   ICON    IDR_ACCEL  -1,  8, 40,   0,  0

   Older versions of IBM RC consider 'IDR_ACCEL' and '-1' to be separate tokens
   while WRC considers them to be a single arithmetic expression. This is
   consistent with IBM's RC version 5. The correct syntax is as follows:

   ICON    IDR_ACCEL, -1,  8, 40,   0,  0
