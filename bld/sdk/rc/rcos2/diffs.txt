Differences between some versions of IBM's RC and WRC
-----------------------------------------------------

 - WRC recogizes octal constants such as 007, 056 etc. Hence values such as 008
   are considered to be an error. This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5
   and also consistent with the C/C++ language.

 - There are differences in parsing statements such as

   #define IDR_ACCEL   1
   ICON    IDR_ACCEL  -1,  8, 40,   0,  0

   Older versions of IBM RC consider 'IDR_ACCEL' and '-1' to be separate tokens
   while WRC considers them to be a single arithmetic expression. This is
   consistent with IBM's RC version 5. The correct syntax is as follows:

   ICON    IDR_ACCEL, -1,  8, 40,   0,  0

 - Using the -zm switch, wrc produces resource files compatible with those
   that IBM RC produces, however, the files are not always identical. In
   particular, the ordering of dialog data within binary resource files is not
   always the same between wrc and IBM RC. This has no effect on the
   semantics of such resource files.
