OpenWatcom setupgui .inf file install script description. 1st draft

The .inf file is devided in sections, indicated by a word between square
brackets, e.g. [Application] . Other than section indicators, the file must
consist of empty lines or lines which content is dependent on the section.
Leading and trailing spaces are ignored. Lines starting with the hash sigh (#)
are treated as comment lines. If a line ends in a trailing backslash '\', then
it is continued on the next line.

Variables.
    Variables have a name and a value. Each time a variable is set in a script it is
    overwritten, except variables which name starts with a '$': They keep the first
    value.

  Magic variables
    FullInstall         If set, all non-magic variables are true
    FullCDInstall       If set, all non-magic variables are true except "HelpFiles"
    UnInstall           If set, all non-magic variables are false
    MinimalInstall      If set, make all file variables false
    SelectiveInstall
    PreviousInstall
    IsNEC

  NonMagic variables
    0
    IsOS2
    IsOS2DosBox
    IsWin
    IsWin32
    IsWin32s
    IsWin95
    IsWinNT
    HelpFiles

Conditions.
    A condition is an expression that evaluates to true or false. They cannot
    be longer than 128 bytes (variable MAXBUF in setupinf.h).
    Conditions consist of one or more variable names plus operators. The operators work
    in Reverse Polish Notation, that is, they operate on the previous or previous two
    varriables or results of operators. The available operators are:
    &   AND     previous two values
    |   OR      previous two values
    !   NOT     previous value
    ?   exist   previous value (must be a file name)

    The default operator is AND.


Section words
[Application]
    This defines global information for this install. Only one keyword is defined.
    Typically global variables are defined/set here. The section can appear multiple
    times, for instance to define more variables. But per script the latest
    DefPMGroup will be in effect.

  DefPMGroup=wcpp32.grp, Watcom C_C++, %DstDir%\watcom.ico
    Defines the global PM group. The first value is the group file name, the second
    is the group name, the optional third is the group's icon file

  $xxxx=aaaa
    If it doesn't exist yet, create global variable xxxx with value aaaa. Do nothing
    if it exists.

  yyyy=bbbb
    (Re)set variable yyyy to value bbbb, create the variable if needed.

[Autoexec]
    This defines value to be added to autoexec.bat. The format is variable name, followed
    by an '=', then the value terminated by a comma, then a condition. If the variable
    is preceded by a + sign, the value is appended to any existing variable, else the
    variable is simply set. Example:
  +PATH=%DstDir%\BINNT,IsWin95

[AutoSet]
    Defines conditional variables, with a variable name and a condition. Example:
    tools16=IsDos IsOS2 IsWin | |

[Config]
    This defines value to be added to config.sys. The format is variable name, followed
    by an '=', then the value terminated by a comma, then a condition. If the variable
    is preceded by a + sign, the value is appended to any existing variable, else the
    variable is simply set. Example:
  FILES=20,IsDOS IsWin |

[DeleteFiles]
    This defines which dialogs, directories or files should be deleted. Each of
    the three possible keywords 'dialog', 'file' or 'directory' is followed by a
    value giving the name of the dialog , file or directory to delete. Examples:

  dialog=FoundMFC21
  file=%DstDir%\binnt\mfc.hlp
  directory=%DstDir%\src\mfc\v21

[Dialog]
    This defines a dialog with the user to get user input. A dialog section
    must have only lines of the form keyword=value . The following keywords
    are valid in a Dialog section

  name=xxxx
      Start a new dialog with the name xxxx. The dialog is referred to with this name.

  condition=MakeDisks !
      Define one or more conditions under which this dialog will be shown
      A condition is a variable name which is true or not. The condition
      can be reversed by following the name with a space and an exclamation mark (!)

  title
      Use the specified text as tile for the dialog

  any_check

  width
      Set the dialog test wrap width

  vis_condition
      Set the visual condition ??

  static_text="Please insert or specify new path"
      Add a static text control to the dialog. If nothing is following the '='
      sign, and empty line is added. The character '@'in static text is replaced
      by the name of the installtion program.

  dynamic_text=FormattedDiskInfo,""

  other_button="&Target...",Target,"Target operating systems:"
      Add a selection button. It needs 3 command separated values. The first is
      the displayed button text, and an '&' before a letter will cause the button
      to be activated if Alt+letter is pressed. The second value is the name of
      a dialog that will be invoked if the button is activated. The third value is
      the explanatory text.
  edit_button

  push_button=-"&Previous..."
  push_button=.+"&OK"
  push_button=?"&Help"
  push_button=^"&Cancel"

  radio_button=ModNow,1,"&Make all the modifications for you"
      Define a radio button. It is followed by three values: a variable name,
      an initial value (1 or 0), and an explantory text. & in front of a letter
      of the text will activate the button (set the variable to 1) if Alt-letter
      is pressed. Of multiple radiobuttons, only 1 will be set to 1, all other
      will be 0.

  check_box=CfgFileCreate,1,"&Create the file"
      Define a check box. It is followed by three values: a variable name,
      an initial value (1 or 0), and an explantory text. & in front of a letter
      of the text will activate the button (toggle the variable between 0 and 1) if
      Alt-letter is pressed. A checkbox is not influenced by other checkboxes in
      the same dialog.

  detail_check=dwin32sdk,"&Win32 SDK...",win32sdk,,"32-&bit Windows SDK"

  check_box_continue
      Like check_box, but placed after it on the same line rather than below
      the previous checkbox.

  edit_control=SrcDir,,"Source Directory:"
      Get a value form the user. It is followed by 3 values: a variable name, an
      optional initial value, and a explanatory text.

  text_window



[Dirs]
    Defines the directories used by the software. Each line names one directory.
    They are internally sequentially numbered started with 1 with the first
    directory in the install script. Each line has three values e.g. :

  binp\dll,1,8
      The first value is the directory name, the second is the target (??), the
      third is the parent. This parent is the number of the directory under which
      this particular directory resides. In the example, "binp" would have been
      the 8th directory line. If the parent is "-1", then ??

[Disks]
    This section defines the names of the disks on which the software is supplied.
    Each line names one disk, e.g. "Disk 1".

[End]

[Environment]
    This defines value to be added to the environment. The form is variable name, followed
    by an '=', then the value terminated by a comma, then a condition. If the variable
    is preceded by a + sign, the value is added to any existing variable, else the
    variable is simply set. Example:
  FILES=20,IsDOS IsWin |

  IDS_WRONGCHECKSUM="Invalid Checksum Error"

[Files]
    Defines each individual file. This is done in the form of 'archive' lines,
    frequently split over multiple lines with the continuation character '\',
    where each archive file contains one or more files, directory and disk
    references, file type and optional conditions under which the archive must be processed.

  pck00063,1,ochook.dll!4t!!,6,-1,2,.,wnthost
    The first value is the name of the archive, then second the
    number of files in the archive in base-36 notation (symbols 0-9 and a-z).
    Then there are as many file specifications as files in the archive, separated
    from each other by a comma, then 5 more fields.
    The rest of the line is split into comma-separated pieces, within each
    piece values are separated with the exclamation mark '!'
  ochook.dll!4t!!
    File specification. The first value is the file name (if the extension is .NLM this
    is flagged internally).
    The second is the base-36 file size in 512 byte blocks.
    The third (optional) value is the base-36 file 'last modified' date (time_t value
    as returned by stat()'s st_mtime), if not supplied the date from the .inf file
    is used.
    The fourth (optional) value is a variable name which will be created if needed and
    associated with the file.
    The fifth (optional) value is an extra indicator, a single letter. If 'o' , it is odbc;
    if 's', it is supplemental; if 'k', it is a core component.
  6,-1,2,.,wnthost
    The first value is the base-36 index of the directory into which the file(s) must be placed.
    The second value is the base-36 old_dir index (?? if the file moves from one dir to another
    in another release??; I guess -1 means no old_dir)
    The third value is the base-36 disk index.
    The fourth value is the file type, which can be '1', 'm' or '$' (?? possibly to do with
    if a file is split over multiple diskettes, where '1' is the first part, 'm' is an
    intermediate part and '$' is the last part). If not specified, it is a single-part file.
    This is used to calculate file sizes.
    The fifth value is a condition.

[ForceDLLInstall]
    This doesn't seem to work looking at the code. An extra define (EXTRA_CAUTIOUS_FOR_DLLS)
    is needed for the code to activate. It purpose might have been to force installation even
    if some paths etc don't match. TBS

[Labels]
    This is used in OS/2 only to add long label to directories using the extended attributes.
    The line format is: directoryname=label

[LicenseMessage]
    Maps a variable name to strings. The variable names are fixed values inside the setup program.
  IDS_APPLYLICENSE="Applying License..."
  IDS_LICENSEMESSAGE="Name and Company name must be filled in"

[MiscMessage]
    Maps a variable name to strings. The variable names are fixed values inside the setup program.

[Patch]
  Defines patches.

  copy
      Copy has four values, respectively source file name, destination directory,
      destination file name, and condition.

  patch
      Patch has five values, respectively source file name, destination directory,
      destination file name, exec type, and condition.

  delete
      Delete has three values, respectively destination file name, destination directory,
      and condition.

  mkdir
      MkDir has two value, destination directory and condition.


[PM Info]
    Defines whether a GUI folder/group will be populated with shortcuts and icons
    to installed files or folders. There are two kinds of lines: those which first
    word is 'GROUP' (case-sensitive), and which define a new group; and other lines,
    which specify a file to be put into the group. Each line has comma-separated
    values. The first two parameters are treated differently for group and file.

  GROUP, wpp32hlp.grp, Watcom C_C++ Tools Help,,, DoCreateHelpIcons IsFortranInstall !
      The first parameter is the group indicator
      The second is the group file name

  view.exe, c_readme.inf, Getting Started,,, IsOS2 DoCreateHelpIcons IsFortranInstall !
      The first parameter is the file name, e.g. executable program name like 'notepad.exe',
      or .hlp file name, or text file name etc.
      The second (optional) parameter is passed as parameters to the first item, if it is
      an executable.

      The third is a description/name of the item
      The optional fourth is the icon file name, which must b present in the [Files] section.
      The optional fifth is the numeric icon position within the file, if there are multiple
      in the file. Only used on Windows.
      The sixth parameter is a condition.


[Profile]
    Defines profile information. 3 examples are given.

  386Enh, *device, %DstDir%\binw\wdebug.386, system.ini, , IsWin IsWin95 | ?%DstDir%\binw\wdebug.386
  boot, +drivers, winmm16.dll, system.ini, , IsWin UnInstall ! win32s
  Help,LocalHelp1,%HDir%\binnt,Software\Microsoft\MFC 3.0 Help,current_user,IsWin32 UnInstall !

      The first parameter is the application name.
      The second the key name. If it starts with a '+' it adds (during install) or deletes (uninstall)
      the value from the key's existing value, which is a space-separated string of values. If it
      starts with an '*', it adds or deletes a device entry to the file (line: device=value).
      The third is the key value.
      The next parameters are optional but no preceding once may be omitted, e.g. if you need the
      last one you need to supply all; but that may be done by supplying a space.
      The fourth is a filename, e.g. the ini file. This can the the name of an OS/2 binary .ini
      file like user.ini, of a text based win.ini style file where lines starting with a '['
      define an application and the lines after that the keys belonging to that application.
      The fifth a hive name (used on windows only), which may have the values "local_machine",
      "current_user" or anything else which is treated as "local_machine" as well. If the hive_name
      is given, the Windows registry is updated.
      The sixth a condition.

[Restrictions]
    Defines conditional variables which must be either true or false. Each line
    in the section must be of the form aaaa=bbbb, where bbbb is either 'true' or
    'false', and aaaa is a variable name. The variable will be created if needed.

[SetupErrorMessage]
    Maps a variable name to strings. The variable names are fixed values inside the setup program.
  IDS_CONTROLCLASSERROR="Invalid control class"
  IDS_CONTROLERROR="Error creating control"
  IDS_FORMATTING_FAILED="Formatting Failed!"
  IDS_HEAPDAMAGE="Head is Damaged"
  IDS_HEAPEMPTY="Heap is Empty"
  IDS_HEAPEND="End of Heap"
  IDS_HEAPOK="Heap OK"
  IDS_NULLSTRING="NULL String"
  IDS_QUERYFSERROR="DosQueryFSInfo error: return code = %ld"
  IDS_WRITEERROR="Error writing to destination file"

[Spawn]
    Runs an external program conditionally. Each line has three parts. The first
    is a keyword which is one of 'end', 'after' or anything else which is treated
    as 'before'. Then there are two values separated by a comma: the first is the
    program to run, the second the condition(s) under which it should run. Example:

    after=cmd.exe /c detach %CDDir%\binp\nmpbind.exe, SrcIsCD IsOS2
