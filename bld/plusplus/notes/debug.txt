        - dump_tokens:  dump tokens as they are scanned
        - dump_parse:   dump parsing information
        - dump_emit_ic: dump intermediate code written to temp. file
        - dump_exec_ic: dump intermediate code read from temp. file
        - dump_ptree:   dump parse trees

        - dump_full:    equivalent to specifying all of above
        - dump_partial: equivalent to specifying all of above, except
