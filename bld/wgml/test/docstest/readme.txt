This file contains notes on the facility created for testing our wgml and ultimately for validating it by showing that it produces byte-wise identical output with wgml 4.0 when applied to the OpenWatcom documents using devices WHELP and PS.

Since this involved modifying the MIF files, the first step was to create a test that can be used to verify that the modified MIF files are using the exact same environment and options as the MIF files used in the repository build. This phase was also used to determine how many different target-specific subdirectories would be needed to cover all the variations.

These tables compare PTF files specifically.
Note 1: If the PTF files are the same, all the files generated by wgml/whpcvt for that document are the same.
Note 2: If these files have been used, additional files created by the help program may be present.
These codes are used:
"same" means the document was present and matches the base document;
"diff" means the document was present but the PTF file (at least) differs from the base document;
"--" means that the document is not present in the tested directory; it may or may not be present in the base directory
"new" means that the document is not present in the base directory but is present in the tested directory.
