//  2002/08/24  -   Checked in a lot of files in the linker code and
//  Change 19349    documentation to support extra NetWare NLM types,
//                  add a new linker option for NetWare, added support
//                  for NetWare symbol prefixing and fixed an issue
//                  where the specified output name would overflow
//                  the internal module name (bugzilla issue 10).
