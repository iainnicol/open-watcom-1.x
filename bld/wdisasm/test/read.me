"RUNTEST" will "bootstrap" the disassembler. It will create
and o1 and o2 directory which may be obliterated after the test.
"RUNTEST 3" does the same for the protected mode version.

If you want to test with tasm, do a "COPY ASM2.BAT ASM.BAT"
If you want to test with masm, do a "COPY ASM3.BAT ASM.BAT"

The tests expect the disassembler to be named "..\o\wdisasm" or
"..\o386\wdisasm".
