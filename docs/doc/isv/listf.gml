ACSL Model  is a complete environment for simulation, modelling, and analyzing
systems described by time-dependent, nonlinear differential equations or
transfer functions.  ACSL Model has powerful instructions,  including a
complete compliment of simulation operators and commands tailored for
continuous simulation and linear analysis.  Included with ACSL Model is the
Graphic Modeller, which is a graphic user interface, block-diagram front end.
.np
The ACSL (Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) consists of two sections:
the model definition and the run time commands.  The model definition involves
establishing mathematical specifications with ACSL statements for the
continuous simulation system being modeled.  The model is then analyzed by
instructions interpreted during the run time command section.  Once a model is
defined, it can be kept on file and analyzed over and over again by the run
time commands since all variables in the model definition can be displayed,
plotted, or printed and any constant or variable changed before a simulation
run.
.np
The Graphic Modeller enables the user to visually create, execute, and analyze
simulation models.  The Graphic Modeller major features include the following:
full compliment of primitives for ACSL instructions, functions, and macros:
user defined blocks: modern drawing package: multiple-view, multiple-editor
environment; and hierarchical modelling, both top down and bottom up.  The
Graphic Modeller helps the user to create a model that is visually meaningful
and easy to understand.

Microcomputer Applications, Inc. has been successfully preventing software
piracy since 1982.  As the oldest supplier of PC based security products, we
have developed products that combine maximum security with maximum reliability.
Our parallel port KEY-LOK device comes with a lifetime warranty against
failure, as further evidence of its durability.  High level program
protection requires a combination of both hardware and software.  The software
portion of the system is designed to prevent pirates from using debugging
utilities to take apart and thus bypass the hardware communication algorithms.
.np
The hardware portion of the system is designed to prevent reverse engineering.
Our security system uses 'active' algorithms so that someone cannot capture a
communication sequence and play it back as a means of bypassing security.  This
device comes with 120 bytes of EEPROM memory to support multi-product/feature
protection.  Optional real-time-clock and KEYTAG for secure memory alteration
are available.
.np
We have been supporting Watcom compilers for several years now.  We support all
of the various options of DOS extenders, and can easily support new ones on the
market within a few days of customer request.  We can also provide a Novell NLM
so that a single device can be used to support multiple nodes on a network.
The NT version of our security system can also be used for multi-session and/or
multi-node control.  We also support OS/2, in addition
to standard DOS and Windows applications.  Our complementary serial port COMPU-
LOCK product can be used to protect software operating on any platform under
any operating system.

ACSL Model  is a complete environment for simulation, modelling, and analyzing
systems described by time-dependent, nonlinear differential equations or
transfer functions.  ACSL Model has powerful instructions,  including a
complete compliment of simulation operators and commands tailored for
continuous simulation and linear analysis.  Included with ACSL Model is the
Graphic Modeller, which is a graphic user interface, block-diagram front end.
.np
The ACSL (Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) consists of two sections:
the model definition and the run time commands.  The model definition involves
establishing mathematical specifications with ACSL statements for the
continuous simulation system being modeled.  The model is then analyzed by
instructions interpreted during the run time command section.  Once a model is
defined, it can be kept on file and analyzed over and over again by the run
time commands since all variables in the model definition can be displayed,
plotted, or printed and any constant or variable changed before a simulation
run.
.np
The Graphic Modeller enables the user to visually create, execute, and analyze
simulation models.  The Graphic Modeller major features include the following:
full compliment of primitives for ACSL instructions, functions, and macros:
user defined blocks: modern drawing package: multiple-view, multiple-editor
environment; and hierarchical modelling, both top down and bottom up.  The
Graphic Modeller helps the user to create a model that is visually meaningful
and easy to understand.

ACSLrt is ACSL ( Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) with real time
extensions.  ACSLrt is for real time simulation.  The primary characteristics
of realtime operation are synchronizing model execution with a realtime clock
and communicating simulation data between the computer and the real world
through a realtime I/O board.  ACSLrt is synchronized with a computer’s real
time clock.  Realtime simulations require precise synchronization between the
model  and the external hardware and Input/Output boards for communication
between the computer and the external hardware.  For the PC computer platform,
ACSLrt includes ACSL with Graphic Modeller for Windows with real time
extensions, Keithley analog and digital Input/Output board, and Watcom FORTRAN
77/32 10.5 compiler.  Major features of ACSLrt are the following: powerful
simulation engine; speed; portability across multiple computer hardware
platforms, including DOS, Windows, and UNIX systems; and an advanced GUI
interface.

FORCHECK is a FORTRAN program development and maintenance aid. It verifies the
syntax, optionally for strict conformance to the FORTRAN 77 or Fortran 90
standard, and warns against possible unintentional misusage of the language
(e.g. a variable being not assigned or unreferenced). FORCHECK detects
undefined variables, signals loss of precision, implicit type conversions and
extension of a common block. Type and usage of all syntactic items are verified
and listed.
.np
In addition to this subprogram-analysis, FORCHECK performs an static analysis
over the program as a whole, across subprogram boundaries. It verifies the
references of subprograms and their argument lists and the consistency of
common-blocks and usage of include files.
.np
FORCHECK composes compact documentation: Subprogram cross-references, a
reference structure of all subprograms, a subprogram index, and cross-reference
tables of subprograms, common blocks, common-block elements, external i/o and
include files.
.np
FORCHECK features a library facility. All global subprogram information can be
stored in library files. New or changed subprograms can be verified using
FORCHECK within the context of the total program, without the need to  re-
analyze the entire program anew. The information of new, or changed, modules
can be added to, or changed in, a library.
.np
FORCHECK supports most language extensions of many compilers and accepts
already many Fortran 90 language features. By enabling the language extensions
of a specific compiler FORCHECK can be used as a conversion aid. FORCHECK can
be tuned and extended by the user to accept compiler directives, intrinsic
functions and keywords for the Open, Close and Inquire statements.
