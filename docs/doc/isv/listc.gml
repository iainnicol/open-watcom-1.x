Dynace is a preprocessor, include files and a library which extends the C
language with advanced object oriented capabilities, automatic garbage
collection and multiple threads.  Dynace is designed to solve many of the
problems associated with C++ while being easier to learn
and containing more flexable object oriented facilities.  Dynace is able to add
facilities previously only available in languages such as Smalltalk and CLOS
without all the overhead normally associated with those environments.

The Dynace Windows Development System (WDS) is a Dynace class library which
enables a C programmer with no knowledge of C++, Dynace, the Windows API or
message-driven architecture to write real Windows applications with an absolute
minimum learning curve and number of lines of code.  In fact, it is possible to
become familiar enough with windows, menus, dialogs and controls using WDS to
write a Windows application after just one day!  A 'Hello World' program takes
only four lines of code!

ObjectMaker TDK by Mark V Systems: The ObjectMaker Tool Development Kit (TDK)
offers developers, integrators, OEMs, consultants, and methodologists the
opportunity to customize methods, notations, syntax rules, syntax checking,
semantic specification and repository capture of all semantics, and other
information and relationships important to your process and problem space.  The
TDK provides direct access to the rules (predicate logic) that create, control,
and pre- and post-condition all tool behavior, and manage all repository
navigation and iteration.  The TDK offers you the possibility of growing your
tool and method support as your organization and process grows and matures.
This is more than just being able to use the next method that
comes along, more than mixing and matching notations to create the multiple
views necessary for today's problems.  It means you can add to the notation you
select, add to the semantics, add to the checking,  add to the code generation,
and more as you gain experience and understand that what you need is beyond
what the published methods offer.  Published methods,
especially the object oriented methods, are good starting points.  Your process
will mature past the published methods. You will need to recognize and capture
the information and relationships important for your problem space.  The
ObjectMaker TDK provides tailorable support which enables you to develop and
extend your own methods.  The TDK gives you the opportunity to use and reuse
your repository contents, your application models, your component libraries by
giving you the facilities for data and control integration with other life
cycle tools.

Tom Sawyer's Graph Layout Toolkit is a family of portable libraries that
deliver an immediate face-lift to graphics applications with their
sophisticated layout algorithms. The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries' logical
representation of objects and connections allow end users to more easily see
underlying relationships within complicated data. The libraries also work in
real time, rarely requiring more than a few seconds to produce quality output
even for large graphs with several hundred nodes.

Four extensible C++ class libraries that include ANSI C APIs make up the Graph
Layout Toolkit family: the Circular, Hierarchical, Orthogonal*, and Symmetric
Layout Libraries. All libraries share a common foundation.

* Orthogonal layout will be generally available with release 2.2 of the Graph
Layout Toolkit in the first quarter of 1996, but can be made available in pre-
release form for select customers.

The Hierarchical library is ideal for the layout of directed graphs.  For
example, it is excellent for drawing complicated function call graphs and for
layout of nested outline PERT charts used in project management applications.

The Circular library is ideal for layout of complicated ring and star
topologies. For example, it may be used to layout complicated IP networks where
devices on the same Class A, Class B or Class C network
or devices on the same subnet are placed around the same circle. It is also
excellent at relating geographic site based information within the framework of
a logical layout product. It functions by partitioning
nodes into logical groups based on a number of flexible node grouping models.
Each group of nodes is placed on radiating circles based on the interconnection
of these groups.

The Symmetric library exposes the natural symmetry inherent in many graph
structures. For instance, this library is superb at rendering arbitrary
enterprise-wide computer networks or mesh networks.

Navigation Features
-------------------------
Graphs help you to manage information, but one graph is often not sufficient.
We provide easy to use, yet powerful tools to help you to manage information
that often spans many graphs.

The Graph Layout Toolkit helps you write powerful graph editing applications
with intelligent window management. Set up hypertext like associations from
nodes and edges in a graph to other graphs whether they are displayed in the
same window or different windows.

Supported Environments
-------------------------
The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries operate with most major operating systems,
compilers and GUI Toolkits. Support is also provided for the ANSI C compiler
designed to work with these C++ compilers listed below.

    SunOS 4.1.x: Sun C++, GNU C++, MetaWare C++ and CenterLine C++

wide range of routines that generate B-Spline, Catmull-Rom, Bezier, quadratic
and NURBS surfaces and curves.  The library makes it easy to compute normals
and tangents to curves and surfaces.  You can perform 3D polygon planar
clipping and view clipping.  View clipping allows you to clip a scene to a
specific view volume.  You can create wire frames of solids such as spheres,
paraboloids, hyperboloids, ellipsoids, regular polyhedrons, cones, cylinders,
pyramids, prisms and more.  You can create complete or partial surfaces of
revolution.  You can extrude solids based on a 2D shape.  There are hidden line
routines that can create scenes with all hidden lines removed.  You can specify
the color of the objects in the hidden transformations such as rotation, scale,
translate mirror and perspective and their respective inverses.  You can
compute the intersection of lines, planes, and curves.  You can create
perspective views of 3D objects or scenes.  Manual & example programs included.

A complete Drawing Library for Windows and DOS.  A complete set of 2D and 3D
(floating point) drawing routines for DOS and Windows.  The command set is the
same for Windows and DOS.  The drawing entities include:  Line, Arc, Circle,
Ellipse, Polyline, Curve, Surface, Solid, Text, Dimensions, Shapes, Insertions,
Blocks and more. Each of the entities can be drawn in 2D or 3D.  You can define
multiple viewports within a window.  Each viewport can have a different view of
an object or group of objects.  This allows you to combine 2D and 3D drawings
within the same window.  You can layer your drawings.  The library comes with
16 vector line styles or you can create your own.  Line styles can be scaled,
they are not pixel based.  Each entity can be drawn in its own coordinate
system.  This give you the ability to import symbols and blocks of data and
draw them at a specific location.  You can dimension your drawings.  All text
is vector based and can be drawn at any angle, size or direction.  You can
create your own text styles or use the ones provided with the library.  A
complete ray tracer and shading program is included with the library.  You can
specify multiple light sources using user defined surface properties such as
ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and Phong highlights.  The shading program
creates spectacular images.  The images created can be output as GIP or PCX
files.  The library comes with a PCX/GIF viewer and a set of routines that will
read, write PCX or GIF file formats.  DXF files read by TG-CAD DXF Translator
can be drawn using the routines in this library.  In fact, the library comes
with a DXF Viewer coompiled and ready to use.  Manual & example programs
included.  Source code available.  30 day limited guarantee.

Todays advanced technologies require complex solutions: Math++ takes away some
of the complexity so that you can focus on the application.
.np
Every matrix class can be initialized with random numbers based on uniform,
Bernoulli, binomial, custom (derived directly from data), exponential, gamma,
normal, and Poisson distributions.
Numerous intelligent operators perform matrix arithmetic easily and
efficiently.
.np
Copy and paste data among different matrices. Overloaded iostream operators
provide unlimited flexibility in implementing object persistence. Other member
functions include inverse, resize, mean, trace, transpose, variance ...  Global
(friend) functions extend the usability of matrices and vectors with functions
like: abs, acos, asin, atan, betaDist, .... sort, sqrt, sum, tan, tanh.
Complex numbers, matrices, and vectors are fully supported.
.np
Math++ vector classes behave like the mathematical constructs that you're
already familiar with. Given a column vector of length n multiply it by a row
vector of length m and you get a matrix of
size nxm - try doing that with other math libraries...
.np
Solutions to real and complex linear equations of the form AX = B, where B is
the constants vector, A is the coefficient matrix, and X is the vector of
unknowns, are easily obtained by creating an LU decomposition server object.
.np
Math++ offers two random number generation algorithms: select between the
highly efficient minimal standard algorithm with period 2^31, or the perfect
pseudo-random number generator with
period 261.  Generate random deviates from uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, custom
(derived directly from data), exponential, gamma, normal, and Poisson
distributions. Create an arbitrary number of
completely independent random deviate generators simultaneously!
.np
The precisely documented FFT server does forward and inverse transforms,
convolution, and correlation of arbitrary length 2^n real and complex vectors.

The Neural++ library features a fully object oriented design, utilizing
features like class inheritance, virtual functions, and object persistence. The
object granularity extends to the
level of layers, collections of fully interconnected neurons. Weight (or
connection) matrices are implemented as objects of class DMatrix, a full-
featured general purpose matrix class (Math++).
.np
Neural++ was developed using Math++, a general purpose C++ mathematics library
from Advanced Computing Labs. The Neural++ package includes the Math++ library.
.np

For example, this is the code needed to create and train a 2 layer BP
(backpropagation) neural network:

BP bpnet( 5, 10, 1 );
    /* BP object: 5 input nodes, 10 hidden, 1 output neuron */
NNData Data;
    /* uninitialized Data object
*/
Data.useDataFile('parity.dat');
    /* initial with raw data from file parity.dat                         */
double error;
while ((error = bpnet.train( &Data, bp_epoch)) > 0.05)
  cout << 'Error ' << error << endl;
.illust end
.np
Math++ library functions can be used to great advantage. For example, to
compute the variance of all data samples corresponding to input node 1,
Neural++ and Math++ functions can be combined:   double variance =
(Data.getData( 1 )).variance(); What could possibly be easier than that!
.np
Neural++ includes Neural++ Tools, a collection of prompt-driven command line
utilities that provide easy access to complex neural objects. Neural++ comes
with close to 600 pages of text
including numerous examples, hints, and complete class by class reference
sections. Neural++ Tools features step-by-step tutorials, walking you through
the tasks of setting up a neural network

Greenleaf ArchiveLib provides the developer with a set of classes and functions
to compress and store ASCII and binary data into an archive for storage, as
well as to retrieve and expand the stored data from the archive.  Data is
compressed and expanded using a proprietary algorithm.  Uncompressed data can
be situated in a file or a memory buffer.  ArchiveLib has been designed to be
flexible for handling any type of data that developers require.  The series of
classes and functions in ArchiveLib is geared to the C++ or C programmer, but
maintains language independence.  It contains a variety of functions to add,
replace, delete, update and retrieve objects of compressed data within the
archive.  ArchiveLib is available as a DLL for access by Windows 3.1 and
Windows NT developers.  Includes complete, fully commented, ANSI C compliant
source code and is royalty free.  Supports most popular C/C++ compilers.

smx++ is a C++ class library which rests on top of smx.  The smx++ Application
Program Interface (API) is designed to mirror smx yet be simpler and easier to
use.  In most cases, smx++ methods call their smx counterparts for system
services.
.np
A chief advantage of smx++ is that it provides a simpler API which meets most
user requirements.  With this in mind, several seldom-used smx features and
functions have been omitted.  Yet,
since smx underlies smx++, direct smx calls are still possible.  This feature
eases the transition from C to C++ by permitting a mix of C and C++ application
modules.
.np
smx++  supports Borland C++ and Microsoft C++.  From the C++ developer's
perspective, the enticing aspect of smx++ is that it allows him to create his
own objects, by inheritance, from smx++ classes.  For example, device drivers
can be derived from the Bucket and Pipe classes  (which, in turn, have been
derived from the Software I/O bus (SIObus) class.)  Process classes can be
derived from a mixture of  smx++ objects to perform  specific work functions.
Actual processes (objects) can be  conveniently created when needed and deleted
when  not
needed.
.np
smx++ consists of 9 base  classes and 7 derived classes.  The class hierarchy
is deliberately shallow in order to achieve the speed necessary for real time
systems.

.np
TOUCH-GUI
.np
is an object-oriented, 32bit C++ class library, which supports mutitasking and
client/server architecture. It includes classes to abstractly handle OS/2 PM
and high-level classes for the applications themselves.
.np
The Product
.np
TOUCH-GUI contains more than 150 C++ classes, which handle the various OS/2 PM
events automatically, but will notify the user of the class, if he so wishes.
These classes support windows, multithreading, menu bars, dialog boxes,
controls (including all OS/2 2.x controls: slider, value set (toolbar),
notebook, container), graphics, printer control, MDI, DDE, Drag and Drop,
loadable resources from DLL's and EXE's, and management of profiles (.INI
files).
.np
Other features include auxiliary classes for comfortable data manipulation and
storage management.
.np
Additionally, TOUCH-GUI contains high-level classes like formatted entry
fields, tables, bitmaps, and NLS (National Language Support).
.np
TOUCH-GUI supplies abstract base classes, which will never have an instance,
but contain the common abilities of various objects. An example is the class
C_WINDOW that defines all common attributes and action schemes for C_VIEW,
C_APPVIEW, and additional PM objects. An
action scheme is a reaction to PM events like resize, move, drag, clip, and
others.
.np
As a special feature, TOUCH-GUI has the ability to find instances of objects
which have been created, but never deleted. This is a very important feature to
improve the quality of an
application program.
.np
All together, these classes build a complete, easy to use class library.
.np
SAA/CUA Standard

Gpf is a Visual application development environment that takes
full advantage of OS/2 2.x to create native Client/Server or
Stand-alone applications for OS/2 PM  or DOS/Windows.  As a 3GL
(C or C++ and optionally PL1) source code generator Gpf offers
all the advantages of hand coding native GUI applications,
combined with the ease of a What You See Is What You Get visual
programming environment.  With Gpf, the designer simply paints
the GUI screens as they ought to appear and Gpf takes care of
the rest.  All interface management and event handling logic is
generated automatically.  Navigation code, custom logic and
context sensitive help are created and linked to objects as they
are designed.  Since these are properly inserted by Gpf, code
integrity during regeneration is assured.

Adding GpfTools provides Reusable objects, Design Browsing, and
Automatic Documentation to create the complete Pro Developers
Toolkit.

Graphical browsing of the design includes a pop up true view of
any window, and automatic documentation. Information may be
output in text or INF (PM viewable) format  In addition,
GpfTools offers a powerful merge facility allowing the developer
to combine designs or  to drag selected objects from the
currently open view and drop them into an accumulate/paste
window.  Copy objects at any level including entire windows,
notebook pages, design objects (presentation objects, user
function objects, user control objects, bitmap/icon/pointer
objects, etc.), even sets of windows with all the associated
objects.

ObjectMaker TDK by Mark V Systems: The ObjectMaker Tool Development Kit (TDK)
offers developers, integrators, OEMs, consultants, and methodologists the
opportunity to customize methods, notations, syntax rules, syntax checking,
semantic specification and repository capture of all semantics, and other
information and relationships important to your process and problem space.  The
TDK provides direct access to the rules (predicate logic) that create, control,
and pre- and post-condition all tool behavior, and manage all repository
navigation and iteration.  The TDK offers you the possibility of growing your
tool and method support as your organization and process grows and matures.
This is more than just being able to use the next method that
comes along, more than mixing and matching notations to create the multiple
views necessary for today's problems.  It means you can add to the notation you
select, add to the semantics, add to the checking,  add to the code generation,
and more as you gain experience and understand that what you need is beyond
what the published methods offer.  Published methods,
especially the object oriented methods, are good starting points.  Your process
will mature past the published methods. You will need to recognize and capture
the information and relationships important for your problem space.  The
ObjectMaker TDK provides tailorable support which enables you to develop and
extend your own methods.  The TDK gives you the opportunity to use and reuse
your repository contents, your application models, your component libraries by
giving you the facilities for data and control integration with other life

Phase3 is a Rapid Application Design environment designed to allow developers
to go quickly from prototype to production.  Phase3 generates C/C++ or Pascal
code for a variety of compilers, including the new optimizing Watcom C/C++
10.5.
.np
Phase3 allows high-level development with visual tools to design screens and
user interface elements, reports, and online help.  Also,  the included visual
database tools can be used to design, maintain and query the Phase3 RDBMS
engine.  Developers can experience the benefits of RAD while still being able
to attach native code directly to Windows messages.  Phase3's unique API Wizard
can guide developers in selecting the correct API call to use and then continue
with descriptions of each of the parameters and returns, including the variable
types for each parameter  the API is expecting - no more obscure API reference
books!
.np
Phase3 developers achieve the best of both high and low level design and can
complete projects in record time yet still have the advantages of having
standard, native (C/C++ or Pascal) code generation which results in true .EXEs
which are as fast as they are small.  The included RDBMS engine can read and
write standard xBASE formats including dBASE and Clipper.  Because Phase3 uses
and generates standard source code, developers can interface with
industry-standard 3rd party tools, including VBX- and DLL-based controls.
Traditional language programmers can now develop applications in record time
without learning a proprietary or interpreted language.

PowerComm Toolkit for Windows is a native Windows 3.1 implementation of
Greenleaf CommLib 5.1.  PowerComm consists of a DLL and a virtual device driver
(VxD).  The DLL contains most of the high level code of CommLib including file
transfer, I/O, status, modem controls and other communications functions.  The
VxD contains the low-level Interrupt Service Routines and other time sensitive
code.  PowerComm implements CommLib's PortOpenGreenleaf(), the most powerful
driver in CommLib, within  Windows.  You can initialize any number of ports
using one or more types of non-intelligent multiport boards in the same PC.
Another unique feature of PowerComm is that it does not 'step on' the Windows
COMM.DRV communications driver.  Requires CommLib 5.1 or 5.2.

model. This allows data to be more available while insuring that a system can
evolve as needs change. Client/server systems are open and modular, therefore
systems can be tailored to particular application requirements, leaving the
choice for cost-effective hardware options open. Coupled with c-tree Plus'
unparalleled portability and proven performance,  FairCom Servers meet even the
most demanding application requirements. FairCom Servers are multi-threaded by
design, allowing previously unused time spent waiting for locks and I/O
operations to be used processing requests from other users. Additionally, these
servers incorporate new indexing technology which allows a very high level of
concurrency among clients without jeopardizing data integrity. Page locks are

FairCom provides configurations for both SQL and non-SQL applications (see
separate description.) Both servers are ultra-high performance servers, which
utilize the widely accepted c-tree Plus Application Programmers Interface. The
FairCom SQL server offers all the features and API of the non-SQL server, plus
a complete ANSI 1986 level 2 SQL engine. Since both configurations are built
using c-tree Plus, applications easily migrate between  three operating modes:
single-user; multi-user non-server; client/server. Change between these modes
by simply recompiling. FairCom's unique implementation of SQL allows the same
executable to access FairCom files using the c-tree Plus low level API, ISAM
level API or SQL API simultaneously. Other
features include: complete client-side source code; native file system
utilization (increases performance); requires less than 1 MB to run; complete
transaction logging and intermediate save/restore points; full commit and
rollback; automatic restart and disaster recovery; full user/file security; on-
line administration utilities and data backup, SQL pre-processor and
interpreter. Available in 5; 12; unlimited user versions. OEM/full server
source available.

generation. Your only programming requirement is to call the r-tree report
function which reads c-tree Plus data files; performs necessary calculations;
monitors control breaks and accumulators; and produces a formatted report.
Because of its unique design, r-tree allows you to distribute report scripts in
either

Gpf is a Visual application development environment that takes
full advantage of OS/2 2.x to create native Client/Server or
Stand-alone applications for OS/2 PM  or DOS/Windows.  As a 3GL
(C or C++ and optionally PL1) source code generator Gpf offers
all the advantages of hand coding native GUI applications,
combined with the ease of a What You See Is What You Get visual
programming environment.  With Gpf, the designer simply paints
the GUI screens as they ought to appear and Gpf takes care of
the rest.  All interface management and event handling logic is
generated automatically.  Navigation code, custom logic and
context sensitive help are created and linked to objects as they
are designed.  Since these are properly inserted by Gpf, code
integrity during regeneration is assured.

Adding GpfTools provides Reusable objects, Design Browsing, and
Automatic Documentation to create the complete Pro Developers
Toolkit.

Graphical browsing of the design includes a pop up true view of
any window, and automatic documentation. Information may be
output in text or INF (PM viewable) format  In addition,
GpfTools offers a powerful merge facility allowing the developer
to combine designs or  to drag selected objects from the
currently open view and drop them into an accumulate/paste
window.  Copy objects at any level including entire windows,
notebook pages, design objects (presentation objects, user
function objects, user control objects, bitmap/icon/pointer
objects, etc.), even sets of windows with all the associated
objects.

Originally introduced in 1988, the FairCom server is based on the client/server
model. This allows data to be more available while insuring that a system can
evolve as needs change. Client/server systems are open and modular, therefore
systems can be tailored to particular application requirements, leaving the
choice for cost-effective hardware options open. Coupled with c-tree Plus'
unparalleled portability and proven performance,  FairCom Servers meet even the
most demanding application requirements. FairCom Servers are multi-threaded by
design, allowing previously unused time spent waiting for locks and I/O
operations to be used processing requests from other users. Additionally, these
servers incorporate new indexing technology which allows a very high level of
concurrency among clients without jeopardizing data integrity. Page locks are
not performed; read locks are not required; extensive'anti-deadlock'
detection/resolution is built-in; sophisticated hashed caching reduces I/O
time; transaction processing on three levels; extensive data
availability/security; client-side source.  Also available in SQL

to the ObjectMaker family which allows rapid development of new method
notations.  MethodMaker also allows the user to modify and extend existing
ObjectMaker and ProcessMaker method support to meet project and organization
requirements. The user can easily build or modify the
tool support for a method by editing a diagram set. The new, or further
prototyped method is self
documented by the defining diagram set, and can be regenerated at any time to
take advantage of new ObjectMaker features and capabilities.  MethodMaker, with
simple diagrams and fill in forms allows you to specify and modify the tool
support for menus, notations, syntax checking, semantics specification and
repository capture of semantics and other information and relationships.  All
ObjectMaker CASE  Tool functionality is inherited.

ObjectMaker by Mark V Systems:  With the ObjectMaker CASE Tool you can model
your application requirements and design in one or more of the most popular
notations.  ObjectMaker supports more than 30 of the most popular analysis and
design notations for software engineering and allows you to mix and match
notations to build a single model of your software application.  You can choose
the notations and the depth of detail your application requires.  ObjectMaker
also offers support for detailed design, code generation and document
generation for construction, delivery and maintenance phases.  Reverse
Engineering tools offer you the opportunity to re-engineer applications, reuse
legacy code and incorporate commercially available components into your model
for design, construction and maintenance.

ObjectMaker TDK by Mark V Systems: The ObjectMaker Tool Development Kit (TDK)
offers developers, integrators, OEMs, consultants, and methodologists the
opportunity to customize methods, notations, syntax rules, syntax checking,
semantic specification and repository capture of all semantics, and other
information and relationships important to your process and problem space.  The
TDK provides direct access to the rules (predicate logic) that create, control,
and pre- and post-condition all tool behavior, and manage all repository
navigation and iteration.  The TDK offers you the possibility of growing your
tool and method support as your organization and process grows and matures.
This is more than just being able to use the next method that
comes along, more than mixing and matching notations to create the multiple
views necessary for today's problems.  It means you can add to the notation you
select, add to the semantics, add to the checking,  add to the code generation,
and more as you gain experience and understand that what you need is beyond
what the published methods offer.  Published methods,
especially the object oriented methods, are good starting points.  Your process
will mature past the published methods. You will need to recognize and capture
the information and relationships important for your problem space.  The
ObjectMaker TDK provides tailorable support which enables you to develop and
extend your own methods.  The TDK gives you the opportunity to use and reuse
your repository contents, your application models, your component libraries by
giving you the facilities for data and control integration with other life
cycle tools.

these tasks. ProcessMaker will generate output to a variety of process
enactment products.  Additional process modeling notations, and other
techniques can be added to ProcessMaker using MethodMaker and ObjectMaker TDK
tools described above.  More than 15 notations are supported at this time

CauseWay is a plug and play replacement for the Watcom C/C++ bundled version of
DOS/4GW.  Once installed, the developer specifies CauseWay as the target
extender and compiles, links, and debugs as usual.

The CauseWay extender binds to the executable file, adding 45K to the file
size; provides full DPMI .9 function support; offers a virtual address space of
4G, and reflects all hardware interrupts to protected mode when a handler is
installed.  It supports EXE file compression and DOS DLLs.   On application
fault, CauseWay creates an error file with extensive CPU state and memory
resource information.  Desired memory settings can be 'burned' into the
application.

CauseWay has faster file I/O, functions, and virtual memory than the bundled
DOS/4GW extender.  No startup advertising banner is displayed when running
CauseWay-built applications.

CauseWay runs all 386 DOS-extended applications in 150K of free conventional
memory with 350K free extended memory, or in 500K conventional memory with no
free extended memory.  (More memory is recommended for larger programs).
CauseWay allocates memory from DPMI, VCPI, XMS, INT 15h and conventional DOS
memory.  Supported environments are MS-DOS 3.1 or higher, Windows 3.1, Windows
'95, and OS/2.  There are no runtime licensing fees.

CauseWay, priced at $195.00, is available from Devore Software & Consulting.

looking at control blocks, queues, and trace buffers.  Besides being an
invaluable debugging tool, smxProbe
will show the user the high-level workings of his code and will strengthen his
understanding of multitasking.
.np
We purposely kept smxProbe simple.  Its functionality is limited to only the
most useful debugging commands. This way, the user is freed from having to
learn yet another complicated development
tool!
.np
The primary features of smxProbe are as follows:  smxProbe maintains three
trace buffers:  error buffer, task trace buffer, and smx call trace buffer.
These are allocated from the far heap.  Each may be up to 64K bytes in size.
Trace buffers can be viewed with the showb() command.  In addition, smxProbe
permits examining smx control blocks and queues.  All information is
presented symbolically and is nicely formatted.  smxProbe allows setting
triggerpoints and breakpoints.  It also permits freezing tasks below a
specified level.  In addition to the smxProbe
commands, all smx calls (e.g. start(atask)) may be executed from the smxProbe
command line.  All functions can be performed while the application is running
or stopped.

HeapAgent is an interactive memory error debugging tool for programmers.
Unlike tools designed for testing, HeapAgent doesnt stop at detecting memory
errors.  You can also use HeapAgents tools to diagnose the cause of each
error.  And because HeapAgent doesnt require relinking or recompiling, works
with your debuggers normal Run or Step commands, and causes minimal
slowdowns in runtime performance (about 25%), you can use it all the time,
thereby detecting and fixing memory bugs much earlier in the development cycle.
HeapAgent detects a broad range of nasty memory errors, and reports more
information about each error than any other memory debugging tool.  In addition
to file and line, HeapAgent provides a sequentially assigned allocation number,
the contents and address of each allocated object, and, most important, a pass
count.  For source lines that allocate more than one object, the pass count
tells you which pass of the line allocated a given object and thereby ties the
error to a specific data object.
HeapAgent includes a comprehensive memory debugger.  You can set breakpoints on
critical heap events, such as the 32nd call to new from foo line 12, or all
calls to new from main.  You can also browse the live heap at any time for heap-
related information, including allocations, their contents, and the source that
created them.  Moreover, these browsers are linked  you can, for example,
click on a byte of memory in the Dump Browser and immediately display the
source that allocated it or display its declared size.

SmartHeap is a professional memory management library and debugging toolkit.
SmartHeap excels in four crucial areas:  speed; error detection; reliability;
and portability.
Speed
In C and C++ applications running on virtual memory systems, malloc and
operator new affect performance more than any other factor.  SmartHeaps
proprietary algorithms deliver unparalleled malloc/new performance, up to 100X
faster.  You can achieve even better results if you use SmartHeaps malloc/new
to automatically route small allocations below a parameterized threshold to an
extremely fast fixed-size allocator, or if you use SmartHeaps multiple memory
pools to improve locality and further eliminate fragmentation.
Error Detection
Because SmartHeap implements and manages the heap, it detects bugs that other
debugging tools miss, thus delivering the most complete heap error detection
available.  In addition, SmartHeap uses its knowledge of the heap to provide
unsurpassed detail about each errors cause.  Bugs detected by SmartHeap
include:  leakage, memory overwrites, double-freeing, wild pointers, invalid
parameters, out of memory, references to previously freed memory, etc.
Portability
SmartHeap ships as binary linkable libraries for DOS, Windows, NT, Mac, OS/2,
UNIX, etc.  Each version provides an identical API, but is specifically
optimized for that particular environment.  Finally, SmartHeaps malloc and new
are strictly ANSI compliant, so you dont have to code to a proprietary API to
realize SmartHeaps benefits.
Reliability
To ensure the ultimate in error-free operation, we built a certification tester
that calls each SmartHeap API hundreds of thousands of times, comprehensively
testing all possible conditions and proving that all the bugs are out.

MemCheck 3.5 Professional for DOS is an automatic runtime debugger for C/C++
applications. MemCheck detects memory overwrites, underwrites, memory leaks,
heap corruption, stack overwrites, out-of-memory conditions, and other memory
errors that cost development projects days and weeks of lost time. MemCheck
detects errors in all parts of the host application, including third-party
vendor libraries.

MemCheck operates completely transparently, allowing simultaneous use of
Watcom's debugger (WD). MemCheck identifies errors by exact file and line
number in the source code. Errors may be directed to the screen, to log files,
or wherever desired. MemCheck provides detailed stack and memory usage
statistics, and stack overflow checking superior to standard compilers. Stack
usage statistics are available at run time, and are reported in a log file.

Installation takes 15 minutes or less, even on large projects (automated by a
configuration utility). No source code changes are required. MemCheck may be
switched on or off at runtime, and overhead on large applications is minimal
(approximately 15K). MemCheck runs 10-300 times faster than similar debuggers,
due to its proprietary storage technology.

You'll find MemCheck invaluable in locating bugs on remote or test machines,
since there's no debug info or external .EXE required. When you're done, simply
link out MemCheck via a 'Production' library, or compile it completely out with
no source code changes.

StratosWare offers an unconditional 60-day money-back guarantee and free
technical support. The price is $139; the upgrade from MemCheck 3.0
Professional for DOS is $49.

***MemCheck 3.5 Professional for Extended DOS***

MemCheck 3.5 Professional for Extended DOS is the only automatic runtime
debugging tool for C/C++ developers supporting both 16- and 32-bit protected
mode under DOS. MemCheck detects memory overwrites, underwrites, memory leaks,
heap corruption, stack overwrites, out-of-memory conditions, and other memory
errors that cost development projects days and weeks of lost time. MemCheck
detects errors in all parts of the host application, including third-party
vendor libraries.

MemCheck operates completely transparently, allowing simultaneous use of

An 'ICE' for Software Developers
.np
Software-only debuggers provide the routine capabilities you need to debug
typical desktop PC software. They enable you to control the execution of the
program you're debugging, i.e., to step through your program at source level,
to break on specified conditions, and to examine and make changes as needed to
registers, ports, and memory locations.  While software debuggers
are intrusive, when you're debugging an application that runs in a typical
desktop environment, this intrusiveness is usually of little or no consequence.
.np
Conditions are quite different when you're debugging embedded and other types
of software where special challenges dictate the use on non-intrusive debugging
tools.  Hardware-assisted debugging tools, such as in-circuit emulators (ICEs),
offer you the visibility and control you need in such situations by giving you
non-intrusive, real-time debugging capabilities. By far the most valuable of
these capabilities is the real-time trace, which records system activity while
the target system runs at full speed.  By specifying what is to be recorded in
the trace buffer, you can collect the information you need to see what is
causing a particular bug.  And as we all know, once you know the cause of a
bug, it is usually easy to fix it.
.illust begin
If you're bringing up new hardware, you may well need an ICE.  But when you're
developing software for a functioning system, the Periscope hardware gives you
all the real-time ICE capability you need.
.illust end
.illust begin
Whenever:
- you're developing speed-critical, real-time software,
- you need ICE (in-circuit emulator) capabilities, but at an affordable price,
- you have timing-related or intermittent problems to track down,
- your system interacts with the real world in complex ways,
- you can't stop your system with breakpoints,
- you can't go to market with bugs,
- you're holding up the project because your software's late, or
- you need a vacation, or at least a weekend off,
.illust end
Periscope can deliver the debugging power you need at an unbeatable price!

you can debug TSRs, device drivers, and interrupt-service routines. Because
Periscope/EM does not depend on DOS, you can debug software interrupts, non-DOS
programs, pre-DOS programs, even DOS itself.
Periscope/EM also handles exception interrupts. As a bonus, when you're using
the Model I board, you can activate Periscope at ROM-scan time so you can debug
add-in ROM.

Trap Uninitialized Pointers and Memory Overwrites Periscope/EM's breakpoints
give you the ability to stop your program's execution whenever it is about to
write into (or read or execute) a range of memory or I/O ports you don't want
it to. When the range is small, you can do this without slowing your program
down by using the debug register breakpoints that Periscope/EM supports. When
the range is larger, you can use software monitor breakpoints. If you need to
run at full speed, you can use Model IV's powerful and sophisticated hardware
breakpoints (requires the Model IV hardware).
.illust end
.illust begin
Easy to Learn and Use Periscope/EM includes optional pull-down menus, automatic
setup,
CodeView and Turbo Debugger function-key emulation, on-screen breakpoint
settings, on-line help, the ability to save and restore debug session
information, and much more, to make it quick and easy to get to Periscope's
considerable capabilities. It also provides symbol and source-
level support for Microsoft, Borland, and other compilers and linkers.
.illust end
.illust begin
Crash Recovery
You get a breakout (NMI) switch with all models of Periscope, so you can break
into the system whenever it crashes, or whenever you want to! The switch is
especially handy when your keyboard's dead and the only alternative is to power
down and back up again.
.illust end
.illust begin
Out of the Way When There's No Room
You can choose whether to load the Periscope/EM software in DOS memory,
extended memory (requires a supporting 386 memory manager), or the Model I
board's memory (requires a Model I board). So when you're debugging software
that needs all or most of the lower 640K, or
that acts differently when you load a debugger in conventional DOS memory,
there are Periscope solutions.
.illust end
.illust begin
AND...The Periscope/EM software takes advantage of the 80386 debug registers to
provide real-time breakpoint capability. It runs on single and dual-monitor
PCs, and can use another PC's video and/or keyboard. It will run with 386
control programs such as 386MAX and QEMM-386
in the system.
.illust end
.illust begin
System Requirements: The Periscope/EM software requires a machine with an 8088
or later CPU; DOS 3.0 or later; one disk drive; and one monitor. To run
Periscope/EM in regular DOS memory, you need an minimum of 75K in the lower
640K. To run Periscope/EM in extended
memory, you need a 386 or later CPU, a supporting 386 memory manager (386MAX,
QEMM, or NETROOM), plus 32K-36K of high DOS memory and 300K of extended memory
(no low DOS memory required). The breakout switch and the Model I board both
require a system with an ISA-compatible bus. Please see the Model IV and
Embedded Periscope literature for the Model IV hardware requirements.

PERISCOPE SOFTWARE OVERVIEW (revised 7/95)
.np
Periscope Model I user Cas Filar writes, 'I find Periscope a terrific tool...I
certainly can recommend it to anyone who makes a living by writing programs in
C and Assembler. For any serious programmer it must be the debugger of choice.
The support you provide is as good as
the debugger itself-simply great.'
.illust begin
Periscope Debuggers
The core Periscope debuggers product line includes Periscope/EM, Periscope/32,
Periscope Model I, and Periscope Model IV. The Periscope/EM software supports
the Model I and Model IV hardware, and is included in the Model I package.
Periscope/32 is a 32-bit aware
derivative of Periscope/EM. It is included in the Periscope/32 for Windows and
Periscope/32 for OS/2 packages, both of which support the Model IV hardware.
.illust end

Blinker 3.2 features a compiler-independent Windows linker, a royalty-free 286
DOS extender, the worlds fastest DOS dynamic overlay linker and an integrated
memory swap function, all in one product forone low price! Compatible with all
the popular C, C++ and FORTRAN compilers, Blinker creates DOS and Windows
programs in seconds, saving hours of valuable programming time.

.np
Why a 286 DOS extender?
The major benefit of a 286 DOS extender is that it will run on any processor
from an 80286 with 1Mb of available memory up to the largest Pentium, whereas a
386 DOS extender requires a minimum of an 80386 processor. The Blinker extender
provides direct access to 16 Mb of
extended memory, runs multi-megabyte programs in protected mode in less than
200 Kb of conventional memory, and solves low memory problems caused by network
shells and other memory hungry TSRs. Fully compatible with DPMI, VCPI and XMS,
so your protected mode programs will run under Windows, DESQview and OS/2 as
well as DOS, it also features a completely transparent virtual memory system to
access up to 64 Mb of virtual memory.

.np
Dual mode - a world first!
Combining a DOS extender with an award-winning linker used by over 50,000
programmers worldwide offers a unique advantage. Blinker 3.0 is the only
product to create dual mode programs, which automatically detect at startup
whether the runtime machine can run in protected mode.  If not, the same
program simply runs in real mode using dynamic overlays, so you can concentrate
on the code instead of worrying about the runtime environment. To create DOS
programs which run within 640 Kb, Blinker calculates the optimum overlay
structure, automatically manages the overlays at runtime and increases
execution speed using an overlay
cache in XMS or EMS. All this is completely invisible to the end user and there
is no size difference between a protected mode program and a dual mode program.
For the first time ever programs will automatically utilize all the available
memory (up to 16 Mb) on every PC, from the
smallest 8086 right up to the Pentium and beyond.

CauseWay is a plug and play replacement for the Watcom C/C++ bundled version of
DOS/4GW.  Once installed, the developer specifies CauseWay as the target
extender and compiles, links, and debugs as usual.

The CauseWay extender binds to the executable file, adding 45K to the file
size; provides full DPMI .9 function support; offers a virtual address space of
4G, and reflects all hardware interrupts to protected mode when a handler is
installed.  It supports EXE file compression and DOS DLLs.   On application
fault, CauseWay creates an error file with extensive CPU state and memory
resource information.  Desired memory settings can be 'burned' into the
application.

CauseWay has faster file I/O, functions, and virtual memory than the bundled
DOS/4GW extender.  No startup advertising banner is displayed when running
CauseWay-built applications.

CauseWay runs all 386 DOS-extended applications in 150K of free conventional
memory with 350K free extended memory, or in 500K conventional memory with no
free extended memory.  (More memory is recommended for larger programs).
CauseWay allocates memory from DPMI, VCPI, XMS, INT 15h and conventional DOS
memory.  Supported environments are MS-DOS 3.1 or higher, Windows 3.1, Windows
'95, and OS/2.  There are no runtime licensing fees.

CauseWay, priced at $195.00, is available from Devore Software & Consulting.
Technical support via phone, fax, BBS, and e-mail is free for the first year
after purchase, including electronic file updates.  All purchases carry a
liberal no-fault return policy.  CauseWay enjoys active, user-influenced,
development.  Call 1-708-717-6369 or fax 1-708-717-6373 for orders.

offers developers, integrators, OEMs, consultants, and methodologists the
opportunity to customize methods, notations, syntax rules, syntax checking,
semantic specification and repository capture of all semantics, and other
information and relationships important to your process and problem space.  The
TDK provides direct access to the rules (predicate logic) that create, control,
and pre- and post-condition all tool behavior, and manage all repository
navigation and iteration.  The TDK offers you the possibility of growing your
tool and method support as your organization and process grows and matures.
This is more than just being able to use the next method that
comes along, more than mixing and matching notations to create the multiple
views necessary for today's problems.  It means you can add to the notation you
select, add to the semantics, add to the checking,  add to the code generation,
and more as you gain experience and understand that what you need is beyond
what the published methods offer.  Published methods,
especially the object oriented methods, are good starting points.  Your process
will mature past the published methods. You will need to recognize and capture
the information and relationships important for your problem space.  The
ObjectMaker TDK provides tailorable support which enables you to develop and
extend your own methods.  The TDK gives you the opportunity to use and reuse
your repository contents, your application models, your component libraries by
giving you the facilities for data and control integration with other life

smxFILE provides embedded systems developers with a DOS-compatible, reentrant
file system.  It features high-performance file i/o and also provides disk
directory management.  smxFILE is
an ANSI C source code library.  The API is similar to POSIX or DOS.  The device
driver interface is similar to UNIX, but simpler.  smxFILE operates in
protected mode as well as in real mode.
.np
The smxFILE package is the latest in a series of DOS file system software
packages that have been marketed since 1987.  It and its predecessors have been
included in many commercial embedded applications.
.np
smxFILE is fully integrated with smx.  An smx call, create_file_mgr(), allows a
task to create its own file managercontrol block (FMCB).  The FMCB is active
whenever the task is active.  As many (or as few) tasks, as desired, may
perform file i/o simultaneously.  Low-level i/o calls to the same disk are
serialized via semaphores (since actual disk operations are inherently non-
reentrant).  A platform, FILEdemo, is provided which illustrates the use of
smxFILE from multiple tasks.

Code for interfacing to standard BIOS disk services and a RAMdisk driver are
included.  Reentrant floppy and IDE drivers are available separately.

SoftProbe 386/TX:  A DOS-hosted source-level debugger that allows downloading
of a
program from the host PC and debugging on the actual 386/486 target system in
real mode and
protected mode.  It accepts executable files in Intel OMF-86/286/386
bootloadable file format.
It also includes a multi-window user interface and a Target Monitor program.

SoftProbe 386/TX has a multi-window interface with pull-down menus, mouse
support, online
help, and overlapping and resizable windows.  The multi-window feature enables
you to
concurrently display command dialog and history, source, registers, memory,
program variables,
execution history, and much more.

SoftProbe 386/TX gives you complete access to symbolic names, data types,
functions, source
statements and source modules in both C and assembly.  C-like expression
evaluation can be
used to examine and modify program objects.  An inline assembler allows program
code to be
input in assembly mnemonics.
The Target Monitor controls program execution on the target.  The Target
Monitor
communicates with the host through a RS-232 serial port and requires 19 KBytes
ROM and 28
KBytes RAM.
The target monitor uses 386 debug registers to facilitate debugging.  It
provides up to 32
breakpoints (program execution breakpoints or data watchpoints).  Program
conditions can
activate breakpoints.  You can define command sequences that are invoked when a
breakpoint is
encountered.

Requires 80386 PC or higher, 2 MBytes of memory,  DOS 5.0 or later, and 3
MBytes of hard
disk space and a RS-232 serial port.  A Microsoft-compatible mouse is
supported, but not
required.

Ellipse, Polyline, Curve, Surface, Solid, Text, Dimensions, Shapes, Insertions,
Blocks and more. Each of the entities can be drawn in 2D or 3D.  You can define
multiple viewports within a window.  Each viewport can have a different view of
an object or group of objects.  This allows you to combine 2D and 3D drawings
within the same window.  You can layer your drawings.  The library comes with
16 vector line styles or you can create your own.  Line styles can be scaled,
they are not pixel based.  Each entity can be drawn in its own coordinate
system.  This give you the ability to import symbols and blocks of data and
draw them at a specific location.  You can dimension your drawings.  All text
is vector based and can be drawn at any angle, size or direction.  You can
create your own text styles or use the ones provided with the library.  A
complete ray tracer and shading program is included with the library.  You can
specify multiple light sources using user defined surface properties such as
ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and Phong highlights.  The shading program
creates spectacular images.  The images created can be output as GIP or PCX
files.  The library comes with a PCX/GIF viewer and a set of routines that will
read, write PCX or GIF file formats.  DXF files read by TG-CAD DXF Translator
can be drawn using the routines in this library.  In fact, the library comes

ACSL Model  is a complete environment for simulation, modelling, and analyzing
systems described by time-dependent, nonlinear differential equations or
transfer functions.  ACSL Model has powerful instructions,  including a
complete compliment of simulation operators and commands tailored for
continuous simulation and linear analysis.  Included with ACSL Model is the
Graphic Modeller, which is a graphic user interface, block-diagram front end.
.np
The ACSL (Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) consists of two sections:
the model definition and the run time commands.  The model definition involves
establishing mathematical specifications with ACSL statements for the
continuous simulation system being modeled.  The model is then analyzed by
instructions interpreted during the run time command section.  Once a model is
defined, it can be kept on file and analyzed over and over again by the run
time commands since all variables in the model definition can be displayed,
plotted, or printed and any constant or variable changed before a simulation
run.
.np
The Graphic Modeller enables the user to visually create, execute, and analyze
simulation models.  The Graphic Modeller major features include the following:
full compliment of primitives for ACSL instructions, functions, and macros:
user defined blocks: modern drawing package: multiple-view, multiple-editor
environment; and hierarchical modelling, both top down and bottom up.  The
Graphic Modeller helps the user to create a model that is visually meaningful
and easy to understand.

Tom Sawyer's Graph Layout Toolkit is a family of portable libraries that
deliver an immediate face-lift to graphics applications with their
sophisticated layout algorithms. The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries' logical
representation of objects and connections allow end users to more easily see
underlying relationships within complicated data. The libraries also work in
real time, rarely requiring more than a few seconds to produce quality output
even for large graphs with several hundred nodes.

Four extensible C++ class libraries that include ANSI C APIs make up the Graph
Layout Toolkit family: the Circular, Hierarchical, Orthogonal*, and Symmetric
Layout Libraries. All libraries share a common foundation.

* Orthogonal layout will be generally available with release 2.2 of the Graph
Layout Toolkit in the first quarter of 1996, but can be made available in pre-
release form for select customers.

The Hierarchical library is ideal for the layout of directed graphs.  For
example, it is excellent for drawing complicated function call graphs and for
layout of nested outline PERT charts used in project management applications.

The Circular library is ideal for layout of complicated ring and star
topologies. For example, it may be used to layout complicated IP networks where
devices on the same Class A, Class B or Class C network
or devices on the same subnet are placed around the same circle. It is also
excellent at relating geographic site based information within the framework of
a logical layout product. It functions by partitioning
nodes into logical groups based on a number of flexible node grouping models.
Each group of nodes is placed on radiating circles based on the interconnection
of these groups.

The Symmetric library exposes the natural symmetry inherent in many graph
structures. For instance, this library is superb at rendering arbitrary
enterprise-wide computer networks or mesh networks.

Navigation Features
-------------------------
Graphs help you to manage information, but one graph is often not sufficient.
We provide easy to use, yet powerful tools to help you to manage information
that often spans many graphs.

The Graph Layout Toolkit helps you write powerful graph editing applications
with intelligent window management. Set up hypertext like associations from
nodes and edges in a graph to other graphs whether they are displayed in the
same window or different windows.

Supported Environments
-------------------------
The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries operate with most major operating systems,
compilers and GUI Toolkits. Support is also provided for the ANSI C compiler
designed to work with these C++ compilers listed below.

    SunOS 4.1.x: Sun C++, GNU C++, MetaWare C++ and CenterLine C++

Blinker 3.2 features a compiler-independent Windows linker, a royalty-free 286
DOS extender, the worlds fastest DOS dynamic overlay linker and an integrated
memory swap function, all in one product forone low price! Compatible with all
the popular C, C++ and FORTRAN compilers, Blinker creates DOS and Windows
programs in seconds, saving hours of valuable programming time.

.np
Why a 286 DOS extender?
The major benefit of a 286 DOS extender is that it will run on any processor
from an 80286 with 1Mb of available memory up to the largest Pentium, whereas a
386 DOS extender requires a minimum of an 80386 processor. The Blinker extender
provides direct access to 16 Mb of
extended memory, runs multi-megabyte programs in protected mode in less than
200 Kb of conventional memory, and solves low memory problems caused by network
shells and other memory hungry TSRs. Fully compatible with DPMI, VCPI and XMS,
so your protected mode programs will run under Windows, DESQview and OS/2 as
well as DOS, it also features a completely transparent virtual memory system to
access up to 64 Mb of virtual memory.

.np
Dual mode - a world first!
Combining a DOS extender with an award-winning linker used by over 50,000
programmers worldwide offers a unique advantage. Blinker 3.0 is the only
product to create dual mode programs, which automatically detect at startup
whether the runtime machine can run in protected mode.  If not, the same
program simply runs in real mode using dynamic overlays, so you can concentrate
on the code instead of worrying about the runtime environment. To create DOS
programs which run within 640 Kb, Blinker calculates the optimum overlay
structure, automatically manages the overlays at runtime and increases
execution speed using an overlay
cache in XMS or EMS. All this is completely invisible to the end user and there
is no size difference between a protected mode program and a dual mode program.
For the first time ever programs will automatically utilize all the available
memory (up to 16 Mb) on every PC, from the
smallest 8086 right up to the Pentium and beyond.

CauseWay is a plug and play replacement for the Watcom C/C++ bundled version of
DOS/4GW.  Once installed, the developer specifies CauseWay as the target
extender and compiles, links, and debugs as usual.

The CauseWay extender binds to the executable file, adding 45K to the file
size; provides full DPMI .9 function support; offers a virtual address space of
4G, and reflects all hardware interrupts to protected mode when a handler is
installed.  It supports EXE file compression and DOS DLLs.   On application
fault, CauseWay creates an error file with extensive CPU state and memory
resource information.  Desired memory settings can be 'burned' into the
application.

CauseWay has faster file I/O, functions, and virtual memory than the bundled
DOS/4GW extender.  No startup advertising banner is displayed when running
CauseWay-built applications.

CauseWay runs all 386 DOS-extended applications in 150K of free conventional
memory with 350K free extended memory, or in 500K conventional memory with no
free extended memory.  (More memory is recommended for larger programs).
CauseWay allocates memory from DPMI, VCPI, XMS, INT 15h and conventional DOS
memory.  Supported environments are MS-DOS 3.1 or higher, Windows 3.1, Windows
'95, and OS/2.  There are no runtime licensing fees.

CauseWay, priced at $195.00, is available from Devore Software & Consulting.
Technical support via phone, fax, BBS, and e-mail is free for the first year
after purchase, including electronic file updates.  All purchases carry a
liberal no-fault return policy.  CauseWay enjoys active, user-influenced,
development.  Call 1-708-717-6369 or fax 1-708-717-6373 for orders.

Todays advanced technologies require complex solutions: Math++ takes away some
of the complexity so that you can focus on the application.
.np
Every matrix class can be initialized with random numbers based on uniform,
Bernoulli, binomial, custom (derived directly from data), exponential, gamma,
normal, and Poisson distributions.
Numerous intelligent operators perform matrix arithmetic easily and
efficiently.
.np
Copy and paste data among different matrices. Overloaded iostream operators
provide unlimited flexibility in implementing object persistence. Other member
functions include inverse, resize, mean, trace, transpose, variance ...  Global
(friend) functions extend the usability of matrices and vectors with functions
like: abs, acos, asin, atan, betaDist, .... sort, sqrt, sum, tan, tanh.
Complex numbers, matrices, and vectors are fully supported.
.np
Math++ vector classes behave like the mathematical constructs that you're
already familiar with. Given a column vector of length n multiply it by a row
vector of length m and you get a matrix of
size nxm - try doing that with other math libraries...
.np
Solutions to real and complex linear equations of the form AX = B, where B is
the constants vector, A is the coefficient matrix, and X is the vector of
unknowns, are easily obtained by creating an LU decomposition server object.
.np
Math++ offers two random number generation algorithms: select between the
highly efficient minimal standard algorithm with period 2^31, or the perfect
pseudo-random number generator with
period 261.  Generate random deviates from uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, custom
(derived directly from data), exponential, gamma, normal, and Poisson
distributions. Create an arbitrary number of
completely independent random deviate generators simultaneously!
.np
The precisely documented FFT server does forward and inverse transforms,
convolution, and correlation of arbitrary length 2^n real and complex vectors.
Approximate data with linear or
non-linear functions, including polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power
functions.

ACSL Model  is a complete environment for simulation, modelling, and analyzing
systems described by time-dependent, nonlinear differential equations or
transfer functions.  ACSL Model has powerful instructions,  including a
complete compliment of simulation operators and commands tailored for
continuous simulation and linear analysis.  Included with ACSL Model is the
Graphic Modeller, which is a graphic user interface, block-diagram front end.
.np
The ACSL (Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) consists of two sections:
the model definition and the run time commands.  The model definition involves
establishing mathematical specifications with ACSL statements for the
continuous simulation system being modeled.  The model is then analyzed by
instructions interpreted during the run time command section.  Once a model is
defined, it can be kept on file and analyzed over and over again by the run
time commands since all variables in the model definition can be displayed,
plotted, or printed and any constant or variable changed before a simulation
run.
.np
The Graphic Modeller enables the user to visually create, execute, and analyze
simulation models.  The Graphic Modeller major features include the following:
full compliment of primitives for ACSL instructions, functions, and macros:
user defined blocks: modern drawing package: multiple-view, multiple-editor
environment; and hierarchical modelling, both top down and bottom up.  The
Graphic Modeller helps the user to create a model that is visually meaningful
and easy to understand.

Blinker 3.2 features a compiler-independent Windows linker, a royalty-free 286
DOS extender, the worlds fastest DOS dynamic overlay linker and an integrated
memory swap function, all in one product forone low price! Compatible with all
the popular C, C++ and FORTRAN compilers, Blinker creates DOS and Windows
programs in seconds, saving hours of valuable programming time.

.np
Why a 286 DOS extender?
The major benefit of a 286 DOS extender is that it will run on any processor
from an 80286 with 1Mb of available memory up to the largest Pentium, whereas a
386 DOS extender requires a minimum of an 80386 processor. The Blinker extender
provides direct access to 16 Mb of
extended memory, runs multi-megabyte programs in protected mode in less than
200 Kb of conventional memory, and solves low memory problems caused by network
shells and other memory hungry TSRs. Fully compatible with DPMI, VCPI and XMS,
so your protected mode programs will run under Windows, DESQview and OS/2 as
well as DOS, it also features a completely transparent virtual memory system to
access up to 64 Mb of virtual memory.

.np
Dual mode - a world first!
Combining a DOS extender with an award-winning linker used by over 50,000
programmers worldwide offers a unique advantage. Blinker 3.0 is the only
product to create dual mode programs, which automatically detect at startup
whether the runtime machine can run in protected mode.  If not, the same
program simply runs in real mode using dynamic overlays, so you can concentrate
on the code instead of worrying about the runtime environment. To create DOS
programs which run within 640 Kb, Blinker calculates the optimum overlay
structure, automatically manages the overlays at runtime and increases
execution speed using an overlay
cache in XMS or EMS. All this is completely invisible to the end user and there
is no size difference between a protected mode program and a dual mode program.
For the first time ever programs will automatically utilize all the available
memory (up to 16 Mb) on every PC, from the
smallest 8086 right up to the Pentium and beyond.

CauseWay is a plug and play replacement for the Watcom C/C++ bundled version of
DOS/4GW.  Once installed, the developer specifies CauseWay as the target
extender and compiles, links, and debugs as usual.

The CauseWay extender binds to the executable file, adding 45K to the file
size; provides full DPMI .9 function support; offers a virtual address space of
4G, and reflects all hardware interrupts to protected mode when a handler is
installed.  It supports EXE file compression and DOS DLLs.   On application
fault, CauseWay creates an error file with extensive CPU state and memory
resource information.  Desired memory settings can be 'burned' into the
application.

SmartHeap is a professional memory management library and debugging toolkit.
SmartHeap excels in four crucial areas:  speed; error detection; reliability;
and portability.
Speed
In C and C++ applications running on virtual memory systems, malloc and
operator new affect performance more than any other factor.  SmartHeaps
proprietary algorithms deliver unparalleled malloc/new performance, up to 100X
faster.  You can achieve even better results if you use SmartHeaps malloc/new
to automatically route small allocations below a parameterized threshold to an
extremely fast fixed-size allocator, or if you use SmartHeaps multiple memory
pools to improve locality and further eliminate fragmentation.
Error Detection
Because SmartHeap implements and manages the heap, it detects bugs that other
debugging tools miss, thus delivering the most complete heap error detection
available.  In addition, SmartHeap uses its knowledge of the heap to provide
unsurpassed detail about each errors cause.  Bugs detected by SmartHeap
include:  leakage, memory overwrites, double-freeing, wild pointers, invalid
parameters, out of memory, references to previously freed memory, etc.
Portability
SmartHeap ships as binary linkable libraries for DOS, Windows, NT, Mac, OS/2,
UNIX, etc.  Each version provides an identical API, but is specifically
optimized for that particular environment.  Finally, SmartHeaps malloc and new
are strictly ANSI compliant, so you dont have to code to a proprietary API to
realize SmartHeaps benefits.
Reliability
To ensure the ultimate in error-free operation, we built a certification tester
that calls each SmartHeap API hundreds of thousands of times, comprehensively
testing all possible conditions and proving that all the bugs are out.

MemCheck 3.5 Professional for DOS is an automatic runtime debugger for C/C++
applications. MemCheck detects memory overwrites, underwrites, memory leaks,
heap corruption, stack overwrites, out-of-memory conditions, and other memory
errors that cost development projects days and weeks of lost time. MemCheck
detects errors in all parts of the host application, including third-party
vendor libraries.

MemCheck operates completely transparently, allowing simultaneous use of
Watcom's debugger (WD). MemCheck identifies errors by exact file and line
number in the source code. Errors may be directed to the screen, to log files,
or wherever desired. MemCheck provides detailed stack and memory usage
statistics, and stack overflow checking superior to standard compilers. Stack
usage statistics are available at run time, and are reported in a log file.

Installation takes 15 minutes or less, even on large projects (automated by a
configuration utility). No source code changes are required. MemCheck may be
switched on or off at runtime, and overhead on large applications is minimal
(approximately 15K). MemCheck runs 10-300 times faster than similar debuggers,
due to its proprietary storage technology.

You'll find MemCheck invaluable in locating bugs on remote or test machines,
since there's no debug info or external .EXE required. When you're done, simply
link out MemCheck via a 'Production' library, or compile it completely out with
no source code changes.

StratosWare offers an unconditional 60-day money-back guarantee and free
technical support. The price is $139; the upgrade from MemCheck 3.0
Professional for DOS is $49.

***MemCheck 3.5 Professional for Extended DOS***

MemCheck 3.5 Professional for Extended DOS is the only automatic runtime
debugging tool for C/C++ developers supporting both 16- and 32-bit protected
mode under DOS. MemCheck detects memory overwrites, underwrites, memory leaks,
heap corruption, stack overwrites, out-of-memory conditions, and other memory
errors that cost development projects days and weeks of lost time. MemCheck
detects errors in all parts of the host application, including third-party
vendor libraries.

MemCheck operates completely transparently, allowing simultaneous use of
Watcom's debugger (WD). MemCheck identifies errors by exact file and line
number in the source code. Errors may be directed to the screen, to log files,

MemCheck aids protected-mode developers by generating a stack trace with symbol
names on GPFs, exceptions, and stack overflow, replacing the default runtime
behaviour of simply printing a register dump and terminating the program.

Automated by a configuration utility, installation takes 15 minutes or less,
and requires no source code changes. MemCheck may be switched on or off at

Dynace is a preprocessor, include files and a library which extends the C
language with advanced object oriented capabilities, automatic garbage
collection and multiple threads.  Dynace is designed to solve many of the
problems associated with C++ while being easier to learn
and containing more flexable object oriented facilities.  Dynace is able to add
facilities previously only available in languages such as Smalltalk and CLOS
without all the overhead normally associated with those environments.

Gpf is a Visual application development environment that takes
full advantage of OS/2 2.x to create native Client/Server or
Stand-alone applications for OS/2 PM  or DOS/Windows.  As a 3GL
(C or C++ and optionally PL1) source code generator Gpf offers
all the advantages of hand coding native GUI applications,
combined with the ease of a What You See Is What You Get visual
programming environment.  With Gpf, the designer simply paints
the GUI screens as they ought to appear and Gpf takes care of
the rest.  All interface management and event handling logic is
generated automatically.  Navigation code, custom logic and
context sensitive help are created and linked to objects as they
are designed.  Since these are properly inserted by Gpf, code
integrity during regeneration is assured.

Adding GpfTools provides Reusable objects, Design Browsing, and
Automatic Documentation to create the complete Pro Developers
Toolkit.

Graphical browsing of the design includes a pop up true view of
any window, and automatic documentation. Information may be
output in text or INF (PM viewable) format  In addition,
GpfTools offers a powerful merge facility allowing the developer
to combine designs or  to drag selected objects from the
currently open view and drop them into an accumulate/paste
window.  Copy objects at any level including entire windows,
notebook pages, design objects (presentation objects, user
function objects, user control objects, bitmap/icon/pointer
objects, etc.), even sets of windows with all the associated
objects.

.np
The WNDX® Portable GUI API supports over 1000 GUI functions including GUI
objects and attributes such as windows, dialogs, menus, text, lists, tables,
graphs and custom controls.  Applications written for the WNDX API are often
smaller, faster and easier to develop and maintain than applications built with
native GUI SDKs. AND they are 100% portable.
.np
When you write your graphical user interface (GUI) source code ONCE in WNDX® it
will transport seamlessly (in as long as it takes to recompile and relink) to
any of the other popular GUI platforms.  Source code you develop to the WNDX
API will recompile across any of all supported platforms with WNDX handling the
differences in the native environments.
.np
With WNDX, you have full access to the underlying API. Many of our customers
extend their Microsoft Windows applications by mixing WNDX and Windows calls
and resources.  The WNDX code is portable.
.np
WNDX uses a 'superset' approach to portability, whereas other companies use
either a subset approach (lowest common denominator of services) which reduces
your options, or a totally simulated approach that is slower and more error
prone. Our 'superset' approach gives you the whole spectrum of over 1000
function calls and attributes, supported on all platforms.

PC-Install is an easy-to-use, professional installation program intended for
anyone who distributes applications or data files - a perfect fit for Watcom
C++ developers.  It provides all of the installation features that you will
ever need yet requires less than 30 minutes to create a completely personalized
installation.  You can designate your own colors for your installation screens,
add personalized titles, display your company logo, and include your own pre-
and post-installation messages. What the end-user sees is your installation
program with titles, messages, and instructions specific to your application.
.np
All necessary installation functions are easily accessible with PC-Install.  It
can check for a particular CPU or display adapter, verify sufficient free disk
space, and even start your program when the installation is complete.  During
installation, PC-Install creates the primary installation directory and any
other required directories, and then copies files to the appropriate locations.
Of course, PC-Install can update AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.  It even modifies
INI files and creates Windows groups and icons.
.np
For software upgrades, you can specify whether PC-Install overwrites already
existing files, have PC-Install ask for overwrite permission, or prevent
overwriting completely.  And you can even allow the user to select groups of
files for installation (e.g., allow the user to select only program files or
only data files for installation).
.np
PC-Install includes PC-Shrink=81, a program that compresses files fo=r
unlimited, royalty-free distribution with PC-Install.  Files can be compressed
one at a time or in groups, and large compressed files can be split across
multiple diskettes when necessary.

Computations involving amounts of money require absolute precision: APMoney++
provides the highest precision integer arithmetic, period.
.np
APMoney++ is a C++ library that implements computer arithmetic of unprecedented
precision, surpassing the competition to set a new standard in high precision
financial arithmetic. While
other vendors toy with 14, 18, or even 28 digits of precision,  APMoney++
raises the bar by implementing 'arbitrary precision' arithmetic. That means you
can represent numbers that require
thousands of digits, hundreds of thousands of digits, even millions of digits.
.np
.illust begin
APMoney DebtAmount('1524367650086546546567657657567067');
\\\\ in pennies
APMoney Interest( DebtAmount * 0.185 );
.illust end
.np
In fact, our algorithms are so powerful, that it is unlikely that any computer
on earth will have sufficient memory to represent a number of the highest
precision attainable with APMoney++.
.np
To avoid loss of precision, early computers relied on BCD (Binary Coded
Decimal) representations of large numbers to do integer and fixed point
arithmetic.  Early microprocessors, for example the
6502, used packed BCD as a native data type to make floating point calculations
possible.  With the advent of floating point coprocessors BCD was no longer
needed, and modern microprocessors do all their integer arithmetic in binary.
Today representing numbers using BCD is wasteful of computer memory, and
implementing arithmetic operations is inefficient, wasting precious CPU time.
.np
Using algorithms based on higher radix number representations, APMoney++
implements integer arithmetic that far surpasses the BCD scheme in terms of
computer efficiency and representational capacity. APMoney++ represents numbers
in base 2^16, where each digit can take on one of 65536 values and is
represented as a 2 byte word or integer. Using a BCD
representation, the same two bytes can be used to store at most 10000 digits.
In terms of representational capacity alone then, APMoney++ realizes a six-fold
increase in efficiency!

The Neural++ library features a fully object oriented design, utilizing
features like class inheritance, virtual functions, and object persistence. The
object granularity extends to the
level of layers, collections of fully interconnected neurons. Weight (or
connection) matrices are implemented as objects of class DMatrix, a full-
featured general purpose matrix class (Math++).
.np
Neural++ was developed using Math++, a general purpose C++ mathematics library
from Advanced Computing Labs. The Neural++ package includes the Math++ library.
.np
Imagine having the full functionality of a mathematics library at your
disposal, ready to be applied to your data, to sets of neurons, to weight
matrices, to experimental neural networks, to anything you can imagine, to
anything you dare imagine...
.np
Imagine the power of an object oriented mathematical development library
designed with the needs of your neural network in mind! Or, stop imagining and
get your hands on Neural++ today!
.np
.illust begin
For example, this is the code needed to create and train a 2 layer BP
(backpropagation) neural network:

BP bpnet( 5, 10, 1 );
    /* BP object: 5 input nodes, 10 hidden, 1 output neuron */
NNData Data;
    /* uninitialized Data object
*/
Data.useDataFile('parity.dat');
    /* initial with raw data from file parity.dat                         */
double error;
while ((error = bpnet.train( &Data, bp_epoch)) > 0.05)
  cout << 'Error ' << error << endl;
.illust end
.np
Math++ library functions can be used to great advantage. For example, to
compute the variance of all data samples corresponding to input node 1,
Neural++ and Math++ functions can be combined:   double variance =
(Data.getData( 1 )).variance(); What could possibly be easier than that!
.np
Neural++ includes Neural++ Tools, a collection of prompt-driven command line
utilities that provide easy access to complex neural objects. Neural++ comes
with close to 600 pages of text
including numerous examples, hints, and complete class by class reference
sections. Neural++ Tools features step-by-step tutorials, walking you through
the tasks of setting up a neural network
project, pre-processing training and validation data, and training a neural
network.

This library has over 240 functions to create or provide fast access to xBASE
files such as dBASE III & IV, Clipper, FoxPro, FoxBASE+, Alpha IV, and
compatible database products.  Library features include:  standalone, multi-
user and network access, automatic record and file locking, built-in disk
caching, index expression evaluation, and searches using full or partial keys.
Routines are supplied to access the following file types: fixed length records
(DBF), variable length memo records (DBT and FBT), and indices (CDX, IDX, MDX,
NDX and NTX).  Now includes high level functions which allow you greater
flexibility; i.e., when you open a database file, it also opens index and memo
files.  New version also includes a C++ layer, relational capabilities, a
Windows Help file, and new Windows demos.  Includes complete, fully commented,
ANSI C compliant source code and Microsoft Windows 3.1 and NT DLL's.

PowerComm Toolkit for Windows is a native Windows 3.1 implementation of
Greenleaf CommLib 5.1.  PowerComm consists of a DLL and a virtual device driver
(VxD).  The DLL contains most of the high level code of CommLib including file
transfer, I/O, status, modem controls and other communications functions.  The
VxD contains the low-level Interrupt Service Routines and other time sensitive
code.  PowerComm implements CommLib's PortOpenGreenleaf(), the most powerful
driver in CommLib, within  Windows.  You can initialize any number of ports
using one or more types of non-intelligent multiport boards in the same PC.
Another unique feature of PowerComm is that it does not 'step on' the Windows
COMM.DRV communications driver.  Requires CommLib 5.1 or 5.2.

offers developers, integrators, OEMs, consultants, and methodologists the
opportunity to customize methods, notations, syntax rules, syntax checking,
semantic specification and repository capture of all semantics, and other
information and relationships important to your process and problem space.  The
TDK provides direct access to the rules (predicate logic) that create, control,
and pre- and post-condition all tool behavior, and manage all repository
navigation and iteration.  The TDK offers you the possibility of growing your
tool and method support as your organization and process grows and matures.
This is more than just being able to use the next method that
comes along, more than mixing and matching notations to create the multiple
views necessary for today's problems.  It means you can add to the notation you
select, add to the semantics, add to the checking,  add to the code generation,
and more as you gain experience and understand that what you need is beyond
what the published methods offer.  Published methods,
especially the object oriented methods, are good starting points.  Your process
will mature past the published methods. You will need to recognize and capture
the information and relationships important for your problem space.  The
ObjectMaker TDK provides tailorable support which enables you to develop and
extend your own methods.  The TDK gives you the opportunity to use and reuse
your repository contents, your application models, your component libraries by
giving you the facilities for data and control integration with other life

Especially efficient for large C/C++/FORTRAN projects.  Now you can speed up
the
compilation  drastically without modifying your source code.  No more 5 hour
compiles.  CPF intercepts calls  to compiler made from your make files and
distributes compilation over several LAN nodes  and/or CPUs on multiple-
processor systems.
.np
Your compilation must run under Windows95 and  Windows/NT 3.5x; cross-compilers
are supported.  Currently works with Microsoft Visual C++  2.x and  4.0 and
Watcom 10.5 desktops.
Command-line C/C++ compilers from Microsoft,  Borland and Watcom are supported
also.  Completely user-configurable.
.np
CPF consists of CPF Server running on local computer and several CPF NetServers
running on  remote machines.  When make utility or batch file is executed on
the local computer, CPF
intercepts command lines and submits them to remote CPF NetServers or executes
them locally  depending on the available resources.  Each of the remote
machines running CPF NetServer uses  its own copy of the compiler.  In order to
decide whether a particular command line could be sent  for execution to remote
machine or has to be executed locally CPF parses the command line and  compares
it with the configuration information.  For example, a compiler command
line could be  executed remotely but LINK command has to be executed on the
local computer.
To increase performance CPF can cache precompiled header files and intermediate
files on remote  nodes.  Each of the remote machines can process multiple
commands simultaniously and
the local  computer can invoke multiple instances of a compiler at the same
time.  This allows for the optimal use of computers with multiple CPUs running
under SMP Windows/NT.
.np
(*1)CPF Monitor utility allows user to monitor execution of jobs by CPF.
Because CPF parses command lines according to configuration information, only
changes to  CPF configuration
are required to accomodate a new compiler release or even a completely new
compiler (*2).
.np
(*1) Not all compilers support multiple simultaneous compiles on the same
computer.
.np
(*2) However, we do not guarantee that any new compiler could be accomodated
just through  configuration changes.

Application/Integrator Workbench is a Windows-based client/server middleware
development tool.  It allows developers to quickly and easily design and
generate the distributed function communications code necessary for desktop and
midrange processes to interoperate
with mainframe application transactions.  The Workbench is a component of
TransAccess Application/Integrator.
.np
The Workbench uses Windows GUI technology to define interfaces for client and
server application code and then generates all the code necessary to interface
with the client and server processes.  Less coding and more functionality make
the Workbench the best
distributed function middleware tool.  Most other distributed function
middleware development tools require programmers to learn new application
programming interfaces (APIs) and write/imbed code.
.np
Using the Workbench, developers can do rapid prototyping to fine-tune
distributed function designs and rapidly build enterprise client/server
applications.  Since all communications design and code generation is completed
from within the Workbench, future communications enhancements are accomplished
using the Workbench rather than having to locate and alter API verbs and
parameters imbedded in application code.

Tom Sawyer's Graph Layout Toolkit is a family of portable libraries that
deliver an immediate face-lift to graphics applications with their
sophisticated layout algorithms. The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries' logical
representation of objects and connections allow end users to more easily see
underlying relationships within complicated data. The libraries also work in
real time, rarely requiring more than a few seconds to produce quality output
even for large graphs with several hundred nodes.

Four extensible C++ class libraries that include ANSI C APIs make up the Graph
Layout Toolkit family: the Circular, Hierarchical, Orthogonal*, and Symmetric
Layout Libraries. All libraries share a common foundation.

* Orthogonal layout will be generally available with release 2.2 of the Graph
Layout Toolkit in the first quarter of 1996, but can be made available in pre-
release form for select customers.

The Hierarchical library is ideal for the layout of directed graphs.  For
example, it is excellent for drawing complicated function call graphs and for
layout of nested outline PERT charts used in project management applications.

The Circular library is ideal for layout of complicated ring and star
topologies. For example, it may be used to layout complicated IP networks where
devices on the same Class A, Class B or Class C network
or devices on the same subnet are placed around the same circle. It is also
excellent at relating geographic site based information within the framework of
a logical layout product. It functions by partitioning
nodes into logical groups based on a number of flexible node grouping models.
Each group of nodes is placed on radiating circles based on the interconnection
of these groups.

The Symmetric library exposes the natural symmetry inherent in many graph
structures. For instance, this library is superb at rendering arbitrary
enterprise-wide computer networks or mesh networks.

Navigation Features
-------------------------
Graphs help you to manage information, but one graph is often not sufficient.
We provide easy to use, yet powerful tools to help you to manage information
that often spans many graphs.

The Graph Layout Toolkit helps you write powerful graph editing applications
with intelligent window management. Set up hypertext like associations from
nodes and edges in a graph to other graphs whether they are displayed in the
same window or different windows.

Supported Environments
-------------------------
The Graph Layout Toolkit libraries operate with most major operating systems,
compilers and GUI Toolkits. Support is also provided for the ANSI C compiler
designed to work with these C++ compilers listed below.

Sun SPARCstation:
    SunOS 4.1.x: Sun C++, GNU C++, MetaWare C++ and CenterLine C++
    Solaris 2.x: Sun C++, GNU C++, MetaWare C++ and CenterLine C++

smx is a real-time multitasking kernel for use in embedded systems.  It is
specifically designed for demanding real-time applications.  It offers a full
suite of kernel services, yet emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.  smx
focuses on the 80x86 processor family and has many features to facilitate 80x86
development.  These increase speed and efficiency of memory usage.
.np
smx also offers full support for the most popular C/C++ compilers and
assemblers, and it is one of only a few kernels to provide a C++ library.   smx
is ROMable for standalone environments.  It
also runs equally well with DOS, and it provides PC support.
.np
smx has been in use for 6 years and has been used in hundreds of applications.
During this time, it has undergone numerous bug fixes and has steadily evolved
into a better and better kernel.
Today, smx is reliable, robust, and highly capable.  It is ready for demanding,
trouble-free use.
.np
smx also features extensive error checking.  Over 70 error types are monitored,
logged, and displayed by the error manager.  This valuable diagnostic tool has
been highly praised by many smx users.
.np
smx is delivered in pre-compiled library form with source-code startup
platforms.  smx source code is available separately.

smxDLM permits independent executable modules (dynamic load modules) to be
loaded and executed as tasks under smx.  Dynamic load modules may be in .exe,
com, or custom formats.  They may be loaded from disk or via data link.  Any
number may run simultaneously, and each may spawn additional tasks.
.np
To run with smxDLM, an application is divided into a resident section and one
or more transient sections.  The resident section includes the standard smx
functions, the DLM loader, and resident application code.  It might be an .exe
file which is loaded via DOS, or it might be permanently in ROM.  The transient
sections are independent 'Dynamic Load Modules'.  These are loaded by the DLM
loader into RAM or flash ROM.
.np
Prior to loading, each DLM is linked with the DLM version of the smx library
(and any other libraries it requires).  The smx DLM library has a pseudo call
of the same name as each smx call.  A pseudo call loads its call i.d. into the
AX register, then executes a software interrupt. (The interrupt level is user
selectable.)
.np
In the resident section, the smx command interpreter, XCOM, interprets the call
i.d., adjusts the stack, and invokes the specified smx call.  The smx call
returns directly to the DLM caller upon completion.  This much of the operation
is transparent to the application code - - it need not know which smx library
(standard or DLM) it has been linked to.

smxProbe is a task-level debugger for high-level debugging of systems based
upon smx.  Unlike code debuggers which allow stepping through or breaking upon
instructions and looking at
variables,  smxProbe allows triggering or breaking upon task operations and
looking at control blocks, queues, and trace buffers.  Besides being an
invaluable debugging tool, smxProbe
will show the user the high-level workings of his code and will strengthen his
understanding of multitasking.
.np
We purposely kept smxProbe simple.  Its functionality is limited to only the
most useful debugging commands. This way, the user is freed from having to
learn yet another complicated development
tool!
.np
The primary features of smxProbe are as follows:  smxProbe maintains three
trace buffers:  error buffer, task trace buffer, and smx call trace buffer.
These are allocated from the far heap.  Each may be up to 64K bytes in size.
Trace buffers can be viewed with the showb() command.  In addition, smxProbe
permits examining smx control blocks and queues.  All information is
presented symbolically and is nicely formatted.  smxProbe allows setting
triggerpoints and breakpoints.  It also permits freezing tasks below a
specified level.  In addition to the smxProbe
commands, all smx calls (e.g. start(atask)) may be executed from the smxProbe
command line.  All functions can be performed while the application is running
or stopped.
.np
smxProbe operates standalone or with a code debugger.  It also can be operated
locally or remotely via a serial link.

continuous simulation and linear analysis.  Included with ACSL Model is the
Graphic Modeller, which is a graphic user interface, block-diagram front end.
.np
The ACSL (Advanced Continuous Simulation Language) consists of two sections:
the model definition and the run time commands.  The model definition involves
establishing mathematical specifications with ACSL statements for the
continuous simulation system being modeled.  The model is then analyzed by
instructions interpreted during the run time command section.  Once a model is
defined, it can be kept on file and analyzed over and over again by the run
time commands since all variables in the model definition can be displayed,
plotted, or printed and any constant or variable changed before a simulation
run.
.np
The Graphic Modeller enables the user to visually create, execute, and analyze
simulation models.  The Graphic Modeller major features include the following:
full compliment of primitives for ACSL instructions, functions, and macros:
user defined blocks: modern drawing package: multiple-view, multiple-editor
environment; and hierarchical modelling, both top down and bottom up.  The

Microcomputer Applications, Inc. has been successfully preventing software
piracy since 1982.  As the oldest supplier of PC based security products, we
have developed products that combine maximum security with maximum reliability.
Our parallel port KEY-LOK device comes with a lifetime warranty against
failure, as further evidence of its durability.  High level program
protection requires a combination of both hardware and software.  The software
portion of the system is designed to prevent pirates from using debugging
utilities to take apart and thus bypass the hardware communication algorithms.
.np
The hardware portion of the system is designed to prevent reverse engineering.
Our security system uses 'active' algorithms so that someone cannot capture a
communication sequence and play it back as a means of bypassing security.  This
device comes with 120 bytes of EEPROM memory to support multi-product/feature
protection.  Optional real-time-clock and KEYTAG for secure memory alteration
are available.
.np
We have been supporting Watcom compilers for several years now.  We support all
of the various options of DOS extenders, and can easily support new ones on the
market within a few days of customer request.  We can also provide a Novell NLM
so that a single device can be used to support multiple nodes on a network.
The NT version of our security system can also be used for multi-session and/or
multi-node control.  We also support OS/2, in addition
to standard DOS and Windows applications.  Our complementary serial port COMPU-
LOCK product can be used to protect software operating on any platform under
any operating system.

Smart Source Code Editor
Unlike most text or source code editors, Object Master understands code and
takes advantage of the language structure. And it's dynamic. Syntax is checked
when code is added or saved and any changes are automatically updated
throughout the project.  You can immediately see the effects of changes made to
code without having to recompile.

Industrial-Strength Browser
Most browsers only let you view individual files. With Object Master, you can
have multiple browser windows open simultaneously, enabling you to work with
several modules or sections of code.  Object Master also provides a high level
of project abstraction, allowing you to visualize the relationship between
various parts of a project.

latest ANSI/ISO draft including exceptions and templates.
.np
PC-lint for C/C++ also includes our traditional C checking, such as,
inconsistent declarations, argument/parameter mismatches, uninitialized
variables, unaccessed variables, variables assigned but not used, suspicious
macros, indentation irregularities, loss of precision, unusual Booleans,
signed/unsigned mismatches, suspicious expressions, unused macros, printf-scanf
irregularities and more.
.np
PC-lint provides for strong type checking based on typedef and it will flag
variables not initialized based on the flow of control.
