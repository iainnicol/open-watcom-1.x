Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 Version 1.0
==================================

Welcome to the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 version 1.0 release! This file contains information about the software package you are about to install. Please read this readme information throughly before installing this software package.

=============================================
DOS/4GW extender included!
=============================================

Tenberry Software has graciously allowed the Open Watcom project to include the commercial DOS/4GW extender. This makes the compiler fully backwards compatible with the older Watcom FORTRAN 77 11.0 compilers. We are also including the freely available CauseWay DOS extender, which is a mostly drop in replacement for DOS/4GW.

=============================================
Full source code available!
=============================================

Open Watcom is an Open Source project, and as such complete source code to the entire product is available from the Open Watcom web site (or on the CD that this installer came on). The source code is distributed under the terms of the Sybase Public License, the text of which is included in this installer. At present you may need a copy of Watcom C/C++ 11.0 in order to rebuild the all of the source code, although most of it builds correctly with the Open Watcom compiler. Soon you should be able to build everything with the Open Watcom compiler. To download the source code, please visit:
